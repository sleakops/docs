# 🚀 Version 1.7.4

<!--truncate-->

05/12/2024

## ✨ New Features

- **Add-on Accessibility:** Added links in SleakOps for easy access to view logs, APM, or metrics for specific resources.
- **OpenTelemetry (Beta):** Introduced an add-on to enhance observability in applications deployed with SleakOps. With OpenTelemetry, you can have your own APM to monitor metrics like request rate, latency, and error rate of your application.
- **Add-on Availability Configurations:** Added various availability settings for each add-on.
- **Documentation:** Updated the add-on documentation and made it available in Spanish.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **Kubecost Integration Review:** Reviewed the Prometheus-Kubecost integration. Kubecost now correctly maps the names of deployed resources to their costs, greatly improving the accuracy of its estimates. It's now possible to enable approximate network traffic cost analysis within the cluster in Kubecost (Beta).
