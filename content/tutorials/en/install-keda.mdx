Learn how to install KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) on your cluster using different methods. KEDA allows you to automatically scale your applications based on events and custom metrics.

## Installation Methods

### Using Lens Interface (option 1)

1. In the Lens menu or the Kubernetes IDE you use, go to **Helm > Charts**.
2. In the search box, type **keda**. The official Bitnami chart should appear:

- `bitnami/keda`

3. Select the version you want (for example, the most recent available).
4. Click on **Install** and in the next window review the values (YAML) for installation if you want to customize something (by default, it is usually sufficient).
5. Confirm the installation by pressing **Install** again.

### Using Helm via Terminal (option 2)

If you prefer the command line or do not have the Helm section in Lens, you can install it like this:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update

# Create a namespace (optional)
kubectl create namespace keda

# Install KEDA
helm install keda bitnami/keda --namespace keda
```

## Installation Verification

After installation, you should see that the KEDA resources have been created:

### In Lens

- Select the namespace where you installed KEDA (by default, `keda` if you created it manually).
- You will see a **Deployment** called `keda-operator`, one or more **Pods**, and other CRD (Custom Resource Definitions) type resources such as `ScaledObjects` and `TriggerAuthentications`.

### Via Terminal (optional)

```bash
kubectl get all -n keda
```

You should see the operator running, for example:

```plain
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/keda-operator-xxxxx-xxxxx               1/1     Running   0          1m
```

If everything is in order, you can now use KEDA for your first autoscaling based on events or custom metrics.

## Define ScaledObject in KEDA

Now we will create a `ScaledObject`. This resource is what tells KEDA how and when to scale the deployment. In this example, we will use a **CPU** trigger, although KEDA handles it internally via `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` (HPA), but the logic integrates with the KEDA CRD.

You can review all possible triggers that KEDA offers in the official documentation <FiExternalLink /> [here](https://keda.sh/docs/2.16/scalers/).

### Creating the ScaledObject

To create this object we will use the extend-charts function in Sleakops. To get there from the project list in Sleakops, go to **Settings > Chart Configuration**.

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/install-keda/keda.png" alt="keda" />
</Zoom>

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/install-keda/keda-2.png" alt="keda-2" />
</Zoom>

Once you are on the Chart Configuration screen, you can add your `ScaledObjects`.

To complete the ScaledObject values, you will need some values such as the namespace and the deployment object name (generated by Sleakops) in the cluster.

- For the namespace, you could use the following annotation, as in the following example: `{{ .Values.global.namespace }}` to extract it from the values that Sleakops already generates
- For the deployment name, we do not currently provide it. To get it, you can enter Lens or your Kubernetes IDE and go to the **Workloads > Deployments** section

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: http-echo-scaledobject
  namespace: { { .Values.global.namespace } }
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    # Must match the Deployment name
    name: http-echo-deployment
  # minReplicaCount and maxReplicaCount determine scaling limits
  minReplicaCount: 1
  maxReplicaCount: 5

  # Trigger that defines the scaling condition (in this case CPU)
  triggers:
    - type: cpu
      metadata:
        type: Utilization # or AverageValue
        value: "50" # scales above 50% CPU
```
