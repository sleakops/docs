# Deploy Build Resources

The Deploy Build Resources configuration allows you to specify the CPU and memory resource requests for both build and deployment processes. This helps ensure that your builds and deployments have sufficient resources to complete successfully while optimizing costs.

## Resource Configuration

/>
</Zoom>

Access the Deploy Build Resources settings:

1. Navigate to **Project** → **Settings**
2. Select **Deploy Build Resources** from the settings menu
3. Configure the resource values according to your project's requirements
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes

### Build Request Resources

Configure the resources allocated during the build process:

- **Build Request CPU**: Specifies the CPU allocation for build processes (measured in millicores)
- **Build Request Memory**: Specifies the memory allocation for build processes (measured in GiB)

### Deploy Request Resources

Configure the resources allocated during the deployment process:

- **Deploy Request CPU**: Specifies the CPU allocation for deployment processes (measured in millicores)
- **Deploy Request Memory**: Specifies the memory allocation for deployment processes (measured in GiB)

:::tip Resource Optimization
- Start with default values and adjust based on build performance
- Monitor build times and resource usage to optimize allocations
- Higher resource allocations can reduce build times but increase costs
:::

:::warning Resource Limits
- Ensure your cluster has sufficient resources to accommodate the requested allocations
