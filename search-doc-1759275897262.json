Be careful, this value should be prudently analyzed as many of this &quot;idle&quot; capacity will be part of a Node that is not yet fully allocated or should be available for your workloads.  Should I be worried if my idle value is too high?​ No, you could optimize this value by reducing the CPU and Memory requests of the workloads deployed in your Project, but bear in mind that many of this capacity is allocated as a maximum limit for your resource utilization even if it is not being used, this gives space for the internal scaling of each workload in case it needs it. By the other side, many of these workloads are cluster-critical so they will have an &quot;idle&quot; capacity to let them scale freely.  Could I review a Namespace more deeply?​ Kubecost has a good granularity of how much specific you could be when analyzing costs, for example, besides Namespace costs you can start digging and by clicking the Namespace you can analyze the costs of the pods, deployments and others it has allocated on it.  Can I analyze something else beside namespaces?​ Yes, from the main dashboard you can analyze more specifically the costs of a specific Node as an entity. It also allows you to review the Storage costs that is being used. For example, for a specific node you could see this:  Does Kubecost has any feature to analyze Networking costs?​ At this moment SleakOps is making available the capacity to allow 'NetworkCosts' which is a feature of Kubecost that estimates the cost of the network traffic that each workload has.

Log Explorer: It's a simple dashboard that allows you to filter by Namespace, Pod, Container and Stream where you can choose between 'stdout' and 'stderr'. It also allows you to search expressions through the 'Search Query' field above.Container Log Dashboard: Similar to the previous but is more close to a Logs Dashboard that lets you analyze more complex cases that you might need. It's slower as it required more processing and for general querying it will not be needed.  Which is the best way to use Loki?​ Minimizing the time-range that is being queried is the best way for fast and error-free logs revision as this parameter is the one with the most influence in the weight of the response. We recommend to first check for a big picture of when the problem occured and then check in Loki for logs in a more specific time-range as, generally, logs quantities could be really high. Bear in mind that Loki contains small processing units for reading, writing and as a controller (backend) so big queries might be slow if not having enough read replicas or processing capacity on them. This is modifiable through Sleakops but will also increase costs.  How can I modify the processing capacity of Loki?​ SleakOps allows you to modify the processing capacity of the deployed Loki through the configuration of the Addon. One way of increasing its capacity is by modifying the quantity of replicas deployed.  How does Loki capture and store logs?​ Loki collects logs from each Node of the cluster and therefore, from every container that it's running on it. In order to achieve this, SleakOps uses Promtail that is the default log Collector for Loki, for that reason, every Node of the cluster will have a Promtail instance deployed on it that is in charge of scrapping and pushing them to the Loki write instance that after a certain period of time pushes it to the S3 for long-term storage.  How is the log collection process?​ The log collector, Promtail, collects and streams to Loki all the logs output through 'stdout' or 'stderr' from each running container in the cluster ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Node Pools","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cluster/nodepools","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"FAQs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Node Pools","url":"/cluster/nodepools#faqs","content":" What are the different kind of node pools?​ Reserved: are instances that you commit to using for a specific term (1 or 3 years) in exchange for significant cost savings (up to 75% less than On-Demand pricing). They provide the best price with commitment and are ideal for: Predictable Workloads: Applications with steady, predictable usage patterns that can benefit from long-term commitment.Production Environments: Critical applications that require guaranteed capacity and cost optimization.Cost Optimization: Workloads where you can commit to usage for extended periods to maximize savings. Spot: are instances that take advantage of spare capacity in a cloud provider's data center, offering up to 90% cost savings compared to On-Demand instances. While they can be terminated if the provider needs capacity back, this is not a limitation but an opportunity for well-architected applications. Ideal for: Cloud-Native Applications: Applications designed with stateless architecture that can handle pod interruptions and restart quickly.Cost-Optimized Workloads: Perfect for applications where significant cost savings (up to 90%) outweigh the need for guaranteed capacity.Resilient Systems: Applications with proper health checks, graceful shutdowns, and automatic restart capabilities. On-Demand: are instances in a Kubernetes cluster that run with a fixed pricing model, providing reliable access to compute resources without the risk of interruption. Can be used: Critical Workloads: Applications that require consistent uptime, such as databases, financial systems, or other critical services.Long-Running Tasks: Tasks that cannot be interrupted without significant consequence. Priority Order: When you select multiple node types, the system will automatically prioritize them in the following order to optimize costs: Reserved (best price with commitment) → Spot (best price without commitment) → On-Demand (highest price but most flexible). For detailed guidance on choosing the right instance types and evaluating application compatibility, see Instance Types and Node Management.  How many Node Pools can I have?​ SleakOps base plan, allows you to have three extra node pool besides the build ones. If you need more, contact us.  Can I convert a spot node pool into an on demand and viceversa?​ You can't directly convert a Spot node pool into an On-Demand node pool or vice versa, but you can achieve the desired outcome through a series of steps in SleakOps. Here’s how you can transition between node pools types: Create a Node Pool of the new desired type.Updade your workloads and projects to run into the new Node Pool.Delete the old node pool if it is not longer needed.

Sleakops will deploy the necessary resources to collect and store the data. Instrumentation is the process of adding code to your application to collect telemetry data. OpenTelemetry provides libraries to instrument your application in a variety of languages. Also Sleakops offers Autoinstrumentation for some languages, learn more about it in the section Autoinstrumentation.  Traces and Metrics​ Telemetry data consist of three main components: traces, metrics and logs. For logs Sleakops offers Loki. Traces are the path of a request through the system, while metrics are the values of the system at a given time. The OpenTelemetry addon collects traces from the pods running your project and sends them to the OpenTelemetry collector. The collector stores the traces throw Tempo . Traces could be visualized in Grafana. Also the collector generates metrics via the SpanMetrics Connector and stores them in Prometheus. A dashboard is available in Grafana for every project that gets instrumented.  Using the Addon​ Let's dive in with a view of the OpenTelemetry dashboard. First three metrics are Request rates, Error rates and Durations, or RED metrics. These metrics are the most important to monitor the health of your application. Then we see a table that list Top operations (endpoints) and their error rate as well. Tipically the dashboard gives a quick look to problematic endpoints, application performance bottlenecks, as well as the overall health of the application.  Autoinstrumentation​ Sleakops offers autoinstrumentation for some languages. This means that Sleakops will automatically instrument your project with OpenTelemetry. This is done by deploying an init container alongside your project. The sidecar container will collect the telemetry data and send it to the OpenTelemetry collector.  Manual instrumentation​ Manual instrumentation resolves the implementation through code of OpenTelemetry in your project. This is done by adding the OpenTelemetry libraries to your project and adding the necessary code to collect the telemetry data. Sleakops presents the endpoint where the telemetry data should be sent.  What does Sleakops install when installing OpenTelemetry​ The stack deployed when the addon is installed is the following: OpenTelemetry Operator OpenTelemetry Collector Custom resource (CRD)OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Custom resource (CRD) for every autoinstrumentated projectTempo with a frontend, and caching enabledS3 Bucket as Tempo Backend  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Start using OpenTelemetry​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Open Telemetry","url":"/cluster/addons/otel#start-using-opentelemetry","content":" To start using OpenTelemetry, you need to install the addon.

Typical Communication Flow​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Resources","url":"/network#2-typical-communication-flow","content":" The following illustrates a typical flow of network traffic in SleakOps:  Access from the Internet: A user accesses a publicly exposed service (e.g., an API). Traffic reaches the Internet Gateway and is routed to the public subnet. Access Control: The Security Group associated with the resource evaluates whether the connection is allowed. Internal Communication: Internal services (in private or persistence subnets) communicate using internal DNS, under Security Group rules. Service Exposure: If a service within a Kubernetes cluster needs to be publicly accessible (e.g., an API), it is exposed via an Application Load Balancer, and External-DNS registers the public domain automatically in Route53.

It acts as a Kubernetes Namespace in the cluster and contains all the services and resources related to the project within that environment.  How do I create a Project in SleakOps?​ The Project and the Project will be created at the same time. You need to connect your Git account (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to SleakOps, select a repository, choose a branch, and specify the location of the Dockerfile. Once these steps are completed, a ProjectEnv is created, and the first image build is triggered. Follow the steps below.  What happens when I create a Project?​ When a Project is created, the following resources are set up: AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store container images and Helm charts.A Kubernetes Namespace to manage services in isolation.A Service Account to handle permissions and secure connections with AWS resources.A Dockerfile analysis to verify its correctness and build a container image using Kaniko  How do I add the Dockerfile Args?​ If any build-time Docker Args (arguments) are required, SleakOps will prompt you to enter them before running the initial build. These arguments can be modified for future builds.  What is the purpose of the Dockerfile in my project?​ The Dockerfile defines how your application is built into a container image. During Project creation, SleakOps analyzes the Dockerfile to ensure it's correctly configured, and then builds the image using Kaniko.  Where are the Docker images stored?​ Docker images are stored in the AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) associated with your project. The images are named after the Project, which combines the environment name and project name.  What is the role of the Service Account?​ The Service Account manages permissions for resources inside the Kubernetes cluster. It allows services deployed in the Project to securely interact with AWS resources like S3, RDS, or any other service your application may require.  Can I update the repository, branch, or Dockerfile path after creating a Project?​ Just the Branch and the Dockerfile Path can be updated. If you need to work with a different Environment, Repository or Name, you will need to create a new record.  How does SleakOps handle the initial image build?​ SleakOps automates the first image build as part of the Project creation process. This initial build ensures faster deployment by utilizing the existing infrastructure. Afterward, future image builds are triggered when services are published in deployments or manually via the Build Form.  How do I control project’s expenses?​ SleakOps allows you to see all your project expenses in one place, classified by account, resources, dates. Access Projects, select one and click the button:  How do I monitor my project?​ You can monitor your project by accessing Projects, selecting one **and clicking into the button:   How do I create a Kubernetes Volume?​ When editing a Project, you can enable and define Kubernetes Volumes by specifying the mount path and storage capacity. SleakOps uses the AWS EFS CSI Driver to manage these volumes as EFS file systems in the EKS cluster.  🚩 How do I manage future builds and deployments?​ Future builds and deployments can be managed manually via the SleakOps interface or automated using the SleakOps CLI.

When should I use Memcached?​ Memcached is ideal for: Simple Caching Needs: If you need a basic, high-speed cache for frequently accessed data.Non-Persistent Data: When you don’t need data to be persisted and can tolerate data loss upon node failure or restart.Horizontal Scalability: For applications that benefit from adding multiple caching nodes to distribute load efficiently.Cost-Sensitive Applications: Memcached is more cost-effective than Redis because it lacks advanced features like persistence and replication.  Why should I choose Memcached over Redis?​ Memcached is a simpler and more cost-effective caching solution if you don't need data persistence, replication, or advanced data types. It's suitable for applications that prioritize fast, distributed caching.  How does Memcached scale in SleakOps?​ Memcached scales horizontally by adding more nodes to your cluster, allowing you to distribute the caching load across multiple nodes.  Does Memcached offer data persistence?​ No, Memcached does not support data persistence. All cached data is stored in memory and will be lost if the node is restarted or fails.  What happens to the cached data if a node fails?​ Cached data in Memcached is volatile, meaning it will be lost if a node fails or is restarted.

This is accomplished using generally purpose-built templates. Once constructed, we upload the Helm chart to the same ECR utilized for the Build images and proceed to deploy a Helm Release into the Kubernetes cluster, specifically within the ProjectEnv namespace.  info All these resources reside in your own AWS Accounts.

The rationale behind this is to optimize uptime, safeguard the current state of the deployed infrastructure, and mitigate potential service downtimes on the Cluster. This imperative arises because Helm templates should always synchronize with the Kubernetes Secrets present in the namespace to avert deployment failures.  As you may already know, if it's not a 'forced' deployment, you'll be presented with an option (switcher) to determine if you wish to deploy your modifications. Deployments are forced in the following scenarios.  Workloads Alias Configuration Changes: A Deployment is forced if any alterations are made to the 'alias' configuration.Dependency: Always forces a Deployment to synchronize its associated VariableGroup state with the templates of the Helm Chart ensuring that Services operation is not affected.VariableGroup Deletion: Same case as Dependency deletion.

How do I set up auto-scaling for my Web Service?​ To enable auto-scaling, you can set the Autoscaling option to enabled and define the Memory Target and CPU Target. These targets determine the resource usage thresholds that trigger auto-scaling. You must also specify the minimum and maximum number of replicas to be maintained when auto-scaling is enabled.  What are the default success codes for a Web Service, and can I change them?​ The default success code is 200, indicating the service is healthy. You can change this code based on your application’s requirements, as some services might return different success codes based on specific actions.  What happens if my health check fails repeatedly?​ If the health check fails consecutively and reaches the Failure Threshold (default is 60), the service is marked as unhealthy, and Kubernetes might restart or terminate the service instance to attempt a recovery.  How can I configure memory and CPU settings for my Web Service?​ You can configure the CPU Request and CPU Limit values to set the minimum and maximum CPU resources each instance in your cluster can use. Similarly, you set Memory Request and Memory Limit for memory allocation per instance.  What are some best practices when configuring a Web Service in SleakOps?​ Always set a minimum of 2 replicas to avoid downtime.Ensure your health check paths and success codes are correctly configured to reflect the true health of your service.Use auto-scaling where possible to optimize resources dynamically based on demand.Review and set memory and CPU usage targets appropriately to prevent overloading your infrastructure.  What should I do if my service shows response times longer than 10 seconds?​ Long response times may indicate issues such as resource constraints, application inefficiencies, or network problems. You should check your service logs, ensure your resources (CPU, memory) are adequately allocated, and review your application code for potential optimizations.  How can I deploy my static web service?​ At the moment, Sleakops doesn’t natively support static sites, but you can still deploy them using the same flow as other sites, by containerizing them with a web server like Nginx. Below is a simple example of a Dockerfile and the corresponding nginx.conf to serve your static content. FROM node:20.11.0-alpine AS base WORKDIR /app FROM base AS build ARG BACKEND_URL WORKDIR /app COPY package.json package-lock.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . ./ RUN npm run build FROM nginx:1.25.3-alpine AS production COPY --from=build /app/config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html EXPOSE 80 CMD [&quot;nginx&quot;, &quot;-g&quot;, &quot;daemon off;&quot;] And here is a sample config/nginx.conf: server { listen 80; location = /health { access_log off; add_header 'Content-Type' 'application/json'; return 200 '{&quot;status&quot;:&quot;OK&quot;}'; } location / { root /usr/share/nginx/html; index index.html index.htm; try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404; add_header Last-Modified $date_gmt; add_header Cache-Control 'no-store, no-cache'; if_modified_since off; expires off; etag off; } } Using this Docker-based approach, you can serve your static site with Nginx, all within a container.
