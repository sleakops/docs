# More on Build

It's easy to understand a Build in the context o [Docker <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.docker.com/) because we can define it just as a Docker image that can be used to compile and assemble source code, dependencies and libraries. 

First of all, this 'images' is what is used to deploy all the services inside Kubernetes as Docker containers through [Helm charts <FiExternalLink/>](https://helm.sh/docs/). Sleakops uses [Kaniko <FiExternalLink/>](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) tool image, which is a tool to create container images from a Dockerfile, inside a Kubernetes cluster. This tool requires access to your repository as it builds the images using the files of the commit that you have provided.
