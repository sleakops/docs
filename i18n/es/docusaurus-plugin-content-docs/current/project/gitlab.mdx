# Gitlab

For [Gitlab <FiExternalLink/>](https://gitlab.com/) you only need to authorize the Sleakops app.

## Set up your self-hosted GitLab to access Sleakops.

If your GitLab is self-hosted (whether on-premise or cloud), follow these steps to integrate your repositories in Sleakops.

Get into the URL: `yourgitlab.com/-/profile/applications` and create a new app, call it Sleakops.
When asked, use these values:

| Name        | Description                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| URLcallback | https://api.sleakops.com/api/integrations/gitlab/callback/ |
| scope       | read                                                       |

Once the application is created, add the `Application ID` and `Secret` generated inside the configuration of your [Sleakops account](https://console.sleakops.com/settings/authorizations).
