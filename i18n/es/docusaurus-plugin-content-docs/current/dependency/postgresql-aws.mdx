- Run a container with the postgres image. The attached volume is the folder with your dump.

```bash
docker run -it --name postgresql-container -v ./initial_data/:/tmp/data/ -e POSTGRESQL_ROOT_USERNAME=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD -d postgres bash
```

- Attach to the terminal to run the pg_dump command
```bash
docker exec -t -i postgresql-container bash
```
- Run the following command replacing the values with the ones of your Dependency. 
To view them from the console you should enter the edition section of the VarGroup for the Dependency.
