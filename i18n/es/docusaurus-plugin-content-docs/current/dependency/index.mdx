# Dependencies
In Sleakops, we refer to the various pieces of other infrastructure items your applications might require to operate in the cloud as "dependencies". 
These dependencies encompass a range of services, including relational databases, storage services, and caches. 
Each dependency is linked to provider-specific services, ensuring seamless integration with the cloud platform.

It's important to note that dependencies in Sleakops are extra services within the AWS ecosystem. 
These services are crucial for enhancing the functionality and performance of your applications, enabling you to leverage the full potential of AWS's extensive suite of cloud services.


## Managing the output
Sleakops simplifies the process of managing dependency outputs through the use of [Variable Groups](/vargroup).

A Variable Group is a Sleakops resource that creates a secret inside the cluster, providing a secure storage solution for sensitive information.

When you create a dependency, Sleakops allows you to customize the keys for the secrets it generates and automatically creates an associated variable group.
For instance, you can easily match the SQL master password with a name that suits your application's requirements. 
This customization empowers you to consume secrets with names that you decide, offering flexibility and control over how your applications interact with essential resources.

Variable Groups securely store and manage the outputs of your dependencies, allowing integration and easy access to sensitive information within your EKS environment. 

## Secure Service Consumption within EKS

At Sleakops, security is a top priority. When it comes to consuming various dependencies, such as relational databases, storage services, and caches, we ensure a secure and streamlined process within your EKS environment. Sleakops achieves this without the need for IAM keys.

By utilizing [Kubernetes Service Accounts <FiExternalLink/>](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/), your applications can directly access the required services within the AWS ecosystem from the EKS cluster. This native integration provides secure and authenticated access without the complexities of managing IAM credentials. With Sleakops, you can effortlessly grant your applications the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services, ensuring a seamless and secure experience.

Let Sleakops handle the creation and management of Service Accounts, so you can focus on building and deploying your applications with confidence. Embrace secure service consumption within your EKS environment with Sleakops, simplifying your cloud-native experience.
