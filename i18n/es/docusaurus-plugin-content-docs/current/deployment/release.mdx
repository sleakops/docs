# Release

## What is a Release?

In Sleakops, a release represents a deployable state of all the services (web services, workers, cron jobs, and jobs) of a [project](/project) in an [environment](/environment).

## Release Creation

Sleakops administers releases for you. Every time you modify, delete, or add a service, worker, hook, or cron job, Sleakops gives you the option to publish the changes. Each time you publish those changes, Sleakops creates a new release with auto-incremented versions.

### Helm Chart Resources

The ingress generates its hosts using `<service_name>.<environment_name>.<organization_name>.<yourdomain.com>`

#### Worker:

- A Kubernetes HPA

#### Hook:

- A Kubernetes job

This job uses Kubernetes hooks to start.

#### Cron Job:
