# Common errors on Providers

If the process of a Provider creation ends in *Error*, usually is because a connection error with the AWS account. 

You’ll find the *Error* status in the provider listing. 

Here are the most common cases and the way to solve them. 

### 1. The Account ID set does not have root access

In this case, by clicking the *Fix* button, you’ll be redirected to AWS again. 

Be sure to be logged as a Root user.

  />
</Zoom>

### 2. Maximum Number of AWS Accounts Reached

AWS has an account limit that can prevent new ones. 

Before retrying the process, increase that limit. Otherwise, the process will fail again.

  />
</Zoom>

### 3. Other errors

Other issues might happen and usually, they'll be solved by running the Connection to AWS again. 

If the error remains and you've tried deleting the provider and creating a new one. Please, do not hesitate and report us an issue.
