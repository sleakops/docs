# Web Services

## Web Services

### Description

A "Web Service" in SleakOps is a continuously running service that provides interfaces and endpoints for interactions with users, other services, and applications. Its primary function is to handle requests like serving web pages, processing API calls, and managing user authentication. It's designed to be always on, ensuring constant availability and responsiveness.

### Usage

To deploy a Web Service, you need to set up the server and define the endpoints that will handle specific types of requests. This service should be scalable to manage varying loads, ensuring smooth operation even during high traffic. It's crucial for a Web Service to have robust error handling and security measures to protect data and maintain service integrity.
