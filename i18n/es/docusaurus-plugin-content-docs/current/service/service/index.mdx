# Services

In SleakOps, efficient management of automated services is key to maintaining robust and effective web and application infrastructure. This main documentation provides an overview of two fundamental types of services: Web Services and Workers. Each of these serves a unique role in service operation and automation, granting users the flexibility and control needed to optimize their operations.

## Introduction

"Services" in SleakOps refer to entities that are always active and operating, ensuring continuous operation and effective interaction of different system components. They are designed to respond to constant demands or to perform background tasks efficiently.

### Web Service

A "Web Service" is an always-active service that provides interfaces and endpoints for interaction with users, other services, and applications. It is essential for functions such as serving web pages, handling API requests, and managing user authentication.

### Worker

"Workers" are services that perform tasks in the background. Unlike Web Services, which respond to external requests, Workers focus on internal tasks such as data processing, sending email notifications, data backups, among others.

## Common Features

Despite their differences, these two types of services share some key characteristics:

- Continuous Operation: Both are designed to be always active, ensuring uninterrupted and efficient operation.
- Automation: They enable automated execution of tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- Flexibility: They can be configured and customized to meet a variety of operational needs.
- System Integration: They integrate seamlessly with the rest of the SleakOps infrastructure, providing cohesive and efficient service management.

### Conclusions

Understanding and effectively utilizing Web Services and Workers is fundamental to the efficient management of automated services in SleakOps. This documentation serves as an introduction to these concepts, providing users with a solid foundation for their implementation and management.
