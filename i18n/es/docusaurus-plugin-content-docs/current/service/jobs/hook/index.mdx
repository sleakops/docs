# Hooks

## Hooks

### Description
A "Hook" is a command that gets triggered and executed in response to a specific event. For example, a Hook might be set to run every time a user registers on an application or when a database updates.

### Usage
To implement a Hook, you first define the event that will trigger the command. Then, link this event to the specific command you want to run. In this way, each time the event occurs, the system will automatically execute the associated Hook.
