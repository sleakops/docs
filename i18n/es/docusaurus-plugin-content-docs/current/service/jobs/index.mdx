# Jobs

In SleakOps, efficient management of automated tasks is key to maintaining robust and effective web and application infrastructure. This main documentation provides an overview of three fundamental types of automated tasks: Jobs, Cronjobs, and Hooks. Each of these categories serves a unique role in task automation and execution, giving users the flexibility and control needed to optimize their operations.

## Introduction
A "Job" refers to a simple command that is launched in a terminal. This task executes once and performs a specific function within the system or application. It's often used for on-the-spot operations such as updates, system checks, or maintenance tasks.

### Jobs
A "Job" in SleakOps refers to a specific task or command that is executed once at a given moment. Jobs are ideal for one-off operations like updates, system checks, or maintenance tasks.

### Cronjobs
"Cronjobs" extends the concept of Jobs, designed to run at predefined regular intervals. These scheduled tasks are essential for operations that need to repeat at consistent intervals, such as daily backups, log cleaning, or periodic updates.

### Hooks

"Hooks" represent a category of tasks that are triggered in response to specific events. They are used to automate actions in response to changes or actions within the system, like executing a script after a database update or sending notifications after a new user is created.

## Common Features
Despite their differences, these three types of tasks share some key characteristics:

- Automation: All allow for the automated execution of tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- Flexibility: They can be configured and customized to suit a variety of operational needs.
- System Integration: They integrate seamlessly with the rest of the SleakOps infrastructure, providing cohesive and efficient task management.

## Conclusions

Understanding and effectively utilizing Jobs, Cronjobs, and Hooks are fundamental to the efficient management of automated tasks in SleakOps. This documentation serves as an introduction to these concepts, providing users with a solid foundation for their implementation and management.
