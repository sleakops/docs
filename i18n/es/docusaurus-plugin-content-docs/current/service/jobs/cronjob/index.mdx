# Cronjobs

## Cronjobs

### Description
A "Cronjob" is a specialized variant of a Job. Instead of executing just once, a Cronjob is scheduled to run at defined regular intervals. For instance, it could be set to run daily at 3 a.m., weekly, or monthly.

### Usage
To set up a Cronjob, you'll need to specify the command to run and the time interval in which you want it to repeat. This configuration ensures the system performs the task automatically without manual intervention.
