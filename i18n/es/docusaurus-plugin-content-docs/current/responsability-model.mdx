# Shared Responsibility Model
We transparently utilize all AWS services, which means the responsibility extends to the guidelines set by AWS.

To safeguard your data and ensure it doesn't get lost due to potential service disruptions, it's advisable to have backup policies in place. Currently, we don't support backups for our dependencies (RDS, S3, RabbitMQ, etc.). To set this up, you can access via your AWS client and define your backup policies.
