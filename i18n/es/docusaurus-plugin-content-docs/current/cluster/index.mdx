# Cluster

A cluster is a group of interconnected computers or instances that work together as a single unit to perform specific tasks or run applications. In the context of [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS), a cluster consists of one or more EC2 instances (nodes) that form the foundation for running containerized applications using Kubernetes orchestration.

When creating a cluster the configuration options offer you the flexibility and control needed to create an EKS cluster that aligns precisely with your requirements. 
In the following sections, we will dive deeper into node provisioning, high-availability, and cluster shutdown features, providing you with valuable insights to manage your EKS cluster effectively. So, let's get started!

## Memory and CPU Limits
During cluster creation, you have the power to define upper limits for memory and CPU resources. 
By setting these limits, you ensure that your resources are utilized effectively, avoiding any over-commitment.


## High-Availability for Reliability
To guarantee constant and reliable availability of your critical systems and services, you can enable the "High-Availability" feature. 
With HA enabled the EKS cluster is distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), providing redundancy and fault tolerance. This way, even if one AZ experiences an issue, your cluster continues to function smoothly, ensuring uninterrupted operations.

## Cluster Shutdown
Another essential option is the "Cluster Shutdown" feature. By enabling this option, you can choose a preferred time window for the cluster to be on. 
This functionality allows you to optimize your resource utilization and minimize costs during idle periods, for instance, for a development cluster.
