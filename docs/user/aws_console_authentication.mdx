# AWS Console authentication

To login into the AWS Console of any of the accounts the first step is to be logged in into your SleakOps user. As described on the ['security' account documentation ](/provider/security_account.mdx) you will have to enter into the 'security' account and from that assume a Role of the account you want. The easiest way to do it is using our frontend dashboard:

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/users/USER-account-switcher.png" alt="USER-account-switcher" />
</Zoom>

This will open the AWS login form, it should appear with the Account ID field automatically filed with the 'security' account ID automatically. If this does not happen it might be because another service is trying to fill the fields.

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/users/USER-aws-security-login.png" alt="USER-aws-security-login" />
</Zoom>

Once logged in into the 'security' account it will be shown as in the following image:

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/users/USER-aws-console-initial.png" alt="USER-aws-console-initial" />
</Zoom>

Now on the AWS console, you have to comeback to the SleakOps dashboard and select to which account you want to login:

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/users/USER-account-switcher.png" alt="USER-account-switcher" />
</Zoom>

This will prompt a new AWS tab to Switch Role into the account you've selected. When you switch account you will stop being on the 'security' AWS account and you'll be on the selected account, on this case I switched to the 'production' account via the 'SleakopsAdminRole' because my user is Admin and I am allowed to take this role.

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/users/USER-switch-role.png" alt="USER-switch-role" />
</Zoom>

For more information of this proccess you can read its [AWS documentation <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html).
