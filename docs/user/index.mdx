# User

Within SleakOps we have three user roles, Viewer, Editor and Admin, only Editors and Admins can create infrastructure but Admins can change other users' accounts and roles.
At this moment SleakOps automatically creates a user on the root account of the provider while giving it enough permissions to rotate to the created Organizations to interact with the created infrastructure. The password given to the created users is: "'user.first_name' '.' 'user.last_name' '-' 'company.name'".  

When you create a [Provider ](/docs/provider/index.mdx) you get a Pritunl VPN where you need a profile so we also create a profile on the VPN. To manipulate the AWS resources through the console or, for example, through Lens, you must be connected to it. To do that you have to download Pritunl and import your profile on the client, find the steps on the [VPN documentation](/docs/vpn.mdx).
