# Deleting a Provider

- This feature allows you to delete a Provider and all that was created under it.
- Only Providers *Successfully Created* and in *Error* can be deleted. So, if you do not see the feature, probably it is in other status.

:::info
⚠️ The created *Organization* and its accounts (management, development, production, and security) will not be automatically deleted. While keeping these accounts under your AWS Root Account does not incur any costs, **we recommend removing** them manually.

## How to delete a Provider

### 1. Select the provider to be deleted

Once you are in the *Providers* section, choose a provider and click on the Three Dots **button to display the *Delete* option.  Click on it.

    alt="provider-delete"
  />
</Zoom>

### 2. Confirm the procedure

You'll see a modal to confirm the action. Remember this action will remove all the infrastructure created on AWS under this Provider.

    alt="provider-confirm-delete"
  />
</Zoom>

### 3. Manually remove the Organization and its Accounts

As it was mentioned before the created *Organization* and its accounts (management, development, production, and security) will not be automatically deleted. 

Access your AWS Root Account to manually remove them by going to [AWS Organizations](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/accounts).

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">

    src="/img/provider/aws/managment-account-helper.png"
    alt="management-account"
  />
</Zoom>
