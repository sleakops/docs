# Providers

In SleakOps a Provider represents the connection to your AWS Cloud, the credentials granted to SleakOps to it and the set of accounts created in order to properly manage the infrastructure. 

On AWS, SleakOps will create an Organization with the name you selected and it will include a set of accounts into it.

In order to provide you with a clear view of your AWS cost and resources, SleakOps activates [AWS Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html)Â Â on your account. Specially SleakOps usesÂ [Cost Allocation Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html)Â .

## Let's create your provider on SleakOps

### 1. Navigate to the providers section

| Domain | Here you must provide the domain you own in which the different environments will be deployed.  It must be delegated to the Primary Route53 of SleakOps manually. Follow the steps described on thisÂ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html. |

### 3. Connect to your AWS Root Account

:::warning
You must be logged into your AWS Root Account.
:::

To start installing your application, we need to connect to your AWS Root Account. Here's how to do it:

- By clicking the *Next* button, youâ€™ll be redirected to AWS to create an IAM role in your main account called "SleakopsIntegrationRole". 
<ol>
    <li>This role lets us access necessary resources, making installation quick and smooth.</li>
    <li>After installation, we will remove this role to keep your account secure.</li>
</ol>

### 4. Ongoing Organizative Unit process started

:::note
Creating your Organizative Unit doesn't generate any cost on your AWS account ðŸ˜ƒ 
:::

Once the connection is established role is created, SleakOps will automatically start the Organizative Unit creation. 

This process will take a few minutes.
