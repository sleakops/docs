# Accounts

## Provider's Accounts

Sleakops implements a well-defined infrastructure architecture designed to optimize operational excellence while ensuring a secure and scalable environment for users. The architecture consists of four accounts, each serving distinct purposes and isolated from one another.

Each account has a VPN instance generated upon the creation of the first cluster.

Once the Accounts are up, we set to each one of them what we call [Network Module](https://www.notion.so/Network-Module-8878f087137540debda5660b2eaa0efa?pvs=21)  it contains a lot of different AWS services that are used to make the network connections inside accounts.

### Security Account

The Security Account serves as a centralized hub for managing IAM users and their access to the system. Learn how to switch between accounts in [AWS Console Autentication](../user/aws_console_authentication).

### **Management Account**

Designed to maintain internal services used for application maintenance, regardless of whether they are shared across accounts. Example: Sentry.

- Contains an EKS cluster with integrated CI/CD (GitHub and HashiCorp Vault).
- Vault manages credentials for CloudWatch, enhancing monitoring capabilities.
- VPC Peering enables private connections to other accounts.

### **Development Account**

For the different stages of your application before it goes into production.

- Contains three environments: dev, QA, and staging.
- Replicas of the prod environment for code writing, testing, and pre-releases.
- Ensures isolated testing to prevent issues for external users.
- Similar architecture to prod but without RDS Slave for reduced high availability requirements.

### Production Account

This account is intended for your application to be installed in a production environment, isolated from the rest of your application's stages.

- Supports external users and requires a fully functional database (RDS Master).
- Utilizes Private DB Subnet for RDS Master, RDS Slave, and ElastiCache, each on different Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
- Backend Deployment with replicas distributed across different AZs.
- Frontend Deployment with LoadBalancer for even distribution of network load.
- Route53 serves as DNS and performs health checks for the application.
- AWS CloudFront serves static frontend content from an S3 bucket.
- RDS Slave acts as a replica of RDS Master for failover scenarios, maximizing uptime.
