# Getting AWS keys

To use Sleakops, you need to provide an access key, and a secret key in the [Provider](/docs/provider/index.mdx) creation page,
which you must obtain from the [AWS console page <FiExternalLink/>](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
These are used to make programmatic calls to the AWS API.

## How to obtain an access key from the Console

Root user access keys provide unrestricted access to your entire AWS account.
As Sleakops needs long-term access keys, we recommend creating a new IAM user and generating access keys for that user instead.
This is also a practice recommended by AWS.

In this tutorial, an AWS account named **sleakops_user** was created.

### Create an IAM user with programmatic access

Enter the console as usual with the email and password you set for your root account.

Then search for the IAM service.

  />
</Zoom>

Next, go to the Users section.

<Zoom>
  <img

    alt="IAM management page"
  />
</Zoom>

Click on Add User button.

<Zoom>
  <img
    src="/img/provider/getting-aws-keys/get-keys-4.png"
    alt="IAM user page, with an arrow pointing to the button"
  />
</Zoom>

Once inside the Add User stepper, give the user a name meaningful to your use case.
Also, check the button Access Key - Programmatic access. If you wish to enter the
AWS console with this user you should check that button as well.

  />
</Zoom>

Go to the Attach Existing policies directly and give the user the AdministratorAccess
policy which allows access to manage all resources.
This policy gives SleakOps access to deploy all the infrastructure needed.
Review other pages of this documentation to learn more about the AWS resources we create for you.

    alt="Second step for creating a user."
  />
</Zoom>

If you wish you may add tags to the user.
Tags give plenty of help in organizing the resources that are created.
SleakOps make use of tags for every resource.

<Zoom>
  <img

    alt="Third step for creating a user."
  />
</Zoom>

Review the details before creating the user.
When you feel that everything is ok, click on Add User

<Zoom>
  <img
    src="/img/provider/getting-aws-keys/get-keys-8.png"
    alt="Fourth step for creating a user."
  />
</Zoom>

The user was successfully created, and the credentials Sleakops needs are shown and
should be introduced directly on the Provider creation page. Remember that the secret
key is only shown once, if you miss it you will need to create another pair and delete
this one. Further information on that issue will be presented in the next section.

## How to manage access keys

Whether you created an IAM user or using the root account (not recommended), you might manage your keys following this section
Once inside the AWS console main page. Click on your username.

<Zoom>
  <img
    src="/img/provider/getting-aws-keys/manage-keys-1.png"
    alt=" step to manage access keys."
  />
</Zoom>

Then go to security credentials.

<Zoom>
  <img
    src="/img/provider/getting-aws-keys/manage-keys-2.png"
    alt=" step to manage access keys."
  />
</Zoom>

Enter the Access keys (access key ID and secret access key) section, where you should
see your keys if any. From here you might deactivate keys, delete them or create
new ones.

<Zoom>
  <img
    src="/img/provider/getting-aws-keys/manage-keys-3.png"
    alt=" step to manage access keys."
  />
</Zoom>

If you need a new key click on Create new access key button.

<Zoom>
  <img
    src="/img/provider/getting-aws-keys/manage-keys-4.png"
    alt=" step to manage access keys."
  />
</Zoom>

You successfully created the keys needed to use on the Provider creation page.
As noted on the AWS console, up to two access keys might exists at a time.
If you need more providers you might need to repeat these steps by creating more IAM users.
