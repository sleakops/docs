# Designing your Infra

## Single Schema Vs. Multi Schema 

SleakOps provides the flexibility and control necessary to build infrastructure tailored to your specific requirements.

While we recommend adopting a **Multiple Schema** configuration to align with best practices, we understand that different stages of your project may require alternative schema configurations.

Here a comparative with two options:

|  | **Multi Schema** ⭐️ | **Single Schema** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Aligned with best practices. You'll set first the *Development* account. | Centralizes your environments within a single cluster. |
| **Account to be used** | Use all accounts as described [here](/provider/accounts)  | Only the *Production* account |
| **Pros** | Increases Security by granting access per account *Production* remains isolated.  | Reduces costs, as it is just one cluster.  |
| **Cons** | More expensive as each environment'll have it own cluster and VPN. | Less secure, ass all environments shares the account.  |

These are just two options; you have the freedom to create the schema that best suits your needs.
