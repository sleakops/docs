# Management Account

Within the context of AWS (Amazon Web Services), the root or Management Account is the initial account created when you first sign up for AWS. This account possesses full and unrestricted permissions to access and manage all resources and services within the AWS account. The Management Account is typically designated when entering AWS Organizations, serving as the primary access point for configuring and overseeing the entire AWS infrastructure.
