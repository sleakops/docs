# AWS Cost Allocation Tags

Most of the AWS Resources lets you add [Tags <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html) as metadata. These tags are generally used to manage, identify, organize, search for and filter the resources. However, they can also be used for filtering the costs of resources, but to be able to use them this way we have to first set them as [Cost Allocation Tags <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html).
We as SleakOps need you to do something for us for the purpose of giving you a good cost monitoring. After you create a Provider we cut out our access to your management account by deleting the SleakopsIntegrationRole you initially created for us, with this, we also loss our chance to transform the tag keys we use for cost monitoring into Cost Allocation Tags (it's more complicated than how it sounds). 

Approximately, one day after you've created your first SleakOps Provider you'll be able to see the tags: Account, Cluster, Environment, ProjectEnv and Dependencies on the Cost Allocation Tags tab of your management account, if you're logged in into the management account you can access there from [here <FiExternalLink/>](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?region=us-east-1#/tags). Once there please select all these Tag Keys and activate them to be Cost Allocation Tags so we can use them to query costs values of your AWS Resources.
