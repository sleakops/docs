# Getting AWS Account ID

The account ID is unique to your AWS account and might look similar to the following example: **"1234-1234-1234"**. AWS uses this account ID to identify your AWS resources across all AWS offerings.
You can find your AWS Account ID in the AWS Management Console. It's displayed in the navigation bar on the upper right. Additionally, you can find your AWS Account ID in the account section of the AWS Billing and Cost Management console.
