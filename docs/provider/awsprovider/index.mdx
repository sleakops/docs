# AWS Provider

## Provider Creation

To begin the installation of your application, we first need to connect to your AWS Management account. This is accomplished by creating a special access rule within your IAM Roles in your main account, which we'll name "SleakopsIntegrationRole." This role will enable us to access the resources required from our system, thereby facilitating a quicker and smoother installation process across all 4 accounts (Production, Development, Management, and Security). Upon completion of the installation, we'll promptly remove this access rule from your main account, ensuring that everything remains safe and secure for our clients.
