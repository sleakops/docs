# GitHub Actions Timeout and Monthly Limits

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** GitHub Actions, Deployment, Timeout, CI/CD, Limits

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users experience deployment failures when using GitHub Actions for CI/CD, with builds taking significantly longer than expected and potentially exceeding GitHub's monthly usage limits.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Deployments that normally take 10-14 minutes are running for 45+ minutes
- GitHub Actions jobs failing after 8 seconds on push
- Multiple deployments getting stuck in "running" state
- CI/CD pipeline failures without clear error messages

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Platform: GitHub Actions integration with SleakOps
- Normal deployment time: 10-14 minutes
- Observed deployment time: 45+ minutes
- Project type: Web application deployment

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs immediately after git push (within 8 seconds)
- Multiple deployments running simultaneously
- Monthly GitHub Actions limits potentially exceeded
- CI.yml configuration appears correct

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="github-limits-check" summary="Check GitHub Actions usage and limits">

To verify if you've exceeded GitHub Actions limits:

1. Go to your **GitHub Organization Settings**
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Billing**
3. Check the **Actions & Packages** section
4. Review:
   - Minutes used this month
   - Available minutes remaining
   - Current plan limits

**Free Plan Limits:**

- 2,000 minutes/month for private repositories
- Unlimited for public repositories

**Paid Plan Limits:**

- Varies by plan (Pro: 3,000 min/month, Team: 10,000 min/month)

<TroubleshootingItem id="sleakops-alternative" summary="Use SleakOps native build and deploy">

Instead of relying on GitHub Actions, you can use SleakOps' native build and deployment system:

1. **Access SleakOps Dashboard**
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to **Build & Deploy** section
4. Configure **Direct Deploy** from SleakOps:

```yaml
# Example SleakOps deployment configuration
build:
  strategy: "sleakops-native"
  timeout: "15m"

deploy:
  auto_deploy: true
  branch: "dev"
  environment: "development"
```

**Benefits:**

- No GitHub Actions minute consumption
- More reliable build times
- Better integration with SleakOps features
- Detailed build logs and monitoring

<TroubleshootingItem id="optimize-github-actions" summary="Optimize existing GitHub Actions workflow">

If you prefer to continue using GitHub Actions, optimize your workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [dev, main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20 # Set explicit timeout

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Use caching to reduce build time
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

      # Optimize Docker builds
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="monitoring-setup" summary="Set up monitoring and alerts">

To prevent future issues, implement monitoring:

**1. GitHub Actions Monitoring:**

```yaml
# Add to your workflow
- name: Notify on long builds
  if: ${{ job.status == 'failure' || job.duration > 1200 }}
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: custom
    custom_payload: |
      {
        text: "Build taking longer than expected: ${{ job.duration }}s"
      }
```

**2. SleakOps Monitoring:**

- Enable build time alerts in SleakOps dashboard
- Set up notifications for builds exceeding 15 minutes
- Monitor resource usage trends

**3. Usage Tracking:**

- Weekly review of GitHub Actions usage
- Set up alerts when approaching 80% of monthly limit
- Consider upgrading GitHub plan if consistently hitting limits

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting-immediate" summary="Immediate troubleshooting steps">

For immediate resolution:

**1. Cancel Running Actions:**

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh run list --status in_progress
gh run cancel [RUN_ID]
```

**2. Check Workflow Status:**

- Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
- Cancel any stuck workflows
- Review logs for specific error messages

**3. Temporary Workaround:**

- Disable GitHub Actions temporarily
- Use SleakOps manual deployment
- Re-enable once limits reset (monthly)

**4. Emergency Deployment:**
If you need immediate deployment:

1. Access SleakOps dashboard
2. Go to project → **Manual Deploy**
3. Select branch and environment
4. Deploy directly through SleakOps
