# Pritunl VPN Connection Issues

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Category:** User  
**Tags:** VPN, Pritunl, Connection, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users experiencing connectivity issues with Pritunl VPN in SleakOps production environment, where the VPN client shows "connecting" status but never establishes a successful connection.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Pritunl client remains in "connecting" state indefinitely
- No error messages displayed in the client
- Unable to access internal resources through VPN
- VPN server appears to be running but connections fail

**Relevant Configuration:**

- VPN Type: Pritunl OpenVPN
- Environment: Production
- Client: Pritunl desktop application
- Profile format: .ovpn configuration file

**Error Conditions:**

- Connection attempts timeout without establishing tunnel
- Issue may be intermittent or persistent
- Problem can occur after profile updates or network changes
- Local network configuration may interfere with connection

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="initial-diagnosis" summary="Initial connectivity verification">

Before troubleshooting the VPN profile, verify basic connectivity to the VPN server:

1. **Test HTTPS connectivity** to the VPN server IP:
   ```bash
   # Replace with your actual VPN server IP
   curl -k https://3.82.69.46/
   ```
2. **Expected behavior**: You should see an HTTPS response (even with certificate warnings)

3. **If no response**: The issue is likely network-related (firewall, ISP blocking, etc.)

<TroubleshootingItem id="profile-regeneration" summary="Regenerate VPN profile">

The most common solution is to regenerate the VPN profile:

1. **Access SleakOps Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **VPN Settings** or **User Profile**
3. **Generate new Pritunl URL**:
   - Look for "Generate VPN Profile" or similar option
   - Click to create a new temporary download link
4. **Download fresh profile**:
   - The generated URLs have limited validity (few hours)
   - Download the new .ovpn profile immediately

<TroubleshootingItem id="profile-reinstallation" summary="Remove and reinstall VPN profile">

Complete profile reinstallation process:

1. **Remove existing profile**:

   - Open Pritunl client
   - Right-click on the problematic profile
   - Select "Delete" or "Remove"

2. **Clear any cached data**:

   - Close Pritunl client completely
   - Restart the application

3. **Install new profile**:
   - Import the newly downloaded .ovpn file
   - Verify profile settings are correct
   - Attempt connection

<TroubleshootingItem id="network-troubleshooting" summary="Network-specific troubleshooting">

If profile regeneration doesn't work, try network-level troubleshooting:

1. **Test different networks**:

   - Try connecting from mobile hotspot
   - Test from different WiFi network
   - This helps identify ISP or local network issues

2. **Check firewall settings**:

   - Ensure OpenVPN ports are not blocked
   - Common ports: 1194 (UDP), 443 (TCP)
   - Temporarily disable local firewall for testing

3. **DNS resolution**:
   - Verify VPN server hostname resolves correctly
   - Try using IP address instead of hostname in profile

For administrators with access to SleakOps backend:

1. **Access Secrets Manager**:

   - Find Pritunl server credentials
   - Access Pritunl admin console

2. **Check server logs**:

   - Review connection attempts in Pritunl logs
   - Look for authentication failures or network errors

3. **Verify server status**:
   - Ensure Pritunl service is running
   - Check server resource usage
   - Verify network connectivity from server side

<TroubleshootingItem id="alternative-solutions" summary="Alternative solutions">

If standard troubleshooting doesn't resolve the issue:

1. **Try different VPN protocols**:

   - Switch between UDP and TCP if options available
   - Test different ports if configurable

2. **Update Pritunl client**:

   - Ensure you're using the latest version
   - Check for compatibility issues

3. **Contact support with details**:
   - Provide VPN server IP and connection logs
   - Include network environment details
   - Specify when the issue started occurring
