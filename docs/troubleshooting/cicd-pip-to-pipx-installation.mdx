# CI/CD Pipeline Error - SleakOps Installation Method

**Date:** October 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** CI/CD, Pipeline, Installation, pipx, Python

## Problem Description

**Context:** CI/CD workflows fail when attempting to install the SleakOps CLI tool using the traditional `pip install` method in GitHub Actions or other CI/CD environments.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- CI/CD pipeline failures during SleakOps installation step
- Installation errors in workflow execution
- Build process interruption at dependency installation phase

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Installation method: `pip install sleakops` (incorrect)
- Environment: CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Python package manager: pip vs pipx

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs during workflow execution
- Happens specifically at the SleakOps installation step
- May be related to dependency conflicts or isolation issues

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="installation-fix" summary="Update installation command in workflow">

The solution is to replace `pip install sleakops` with `pipx install sleakops` in your CI/CD workflow configuration.

**Before (incorrect):**

```yaml
- name: Install SleakOps
  run: pip install sleakops
```

**After (correct):**

```yaml
- name: Install SleakOps
  run: pipx install sleakops
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="why-pipx" summary="Why use pipx instead of pip?">

`pipx` is the recommended method for installing Python CLI applications because:

1. **Isolation**: Creates isolated environments for each application
2. **No conflicts**: Prevents dependency conflicts with other Python packages
3. **Clean installation**: Keeps your global Python environment clean
4. **Better for CLI tools**: Specifically designed for command-line applications

Here's a complete example of how to properly install SleakOps in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy with SleakOps

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install pipx
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          python -m pip install pipx
          python -m pipx ensurepath

      - name: Install SleakOps
        run: pipx install sleakops

      - name: Deploy application
        run: |
          sleakops deploy
        env:
          SLEAKOPS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLEAKOPS_TOKEN }}
```

**GitLab CI (.gitlab-ci.yml):**

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: python:3.9
  before_script:
    - pip install pipx
    - pipx install sleakops
  script:
    - sleakops deploy
```

**Jenkins Pipeline:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Install SleakOps') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install pipx'
                sh 'pipx install sleakops'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'sleakops deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you still encounter issues after switching to pipx:

1. **Ensure pipx is installed:**

   ```bash
   python -m pip install pipx
   python -m pipx ensurepath
   ```

2. **Check Python version compatibility:**

   - SleakOps requires Python 3.7 or higher
   - Use `python --version` to verify

3. **Clear pipx cache if needed:**

   ```bash
   pipx uninstall sleakops
   pipx install sleakops
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   sleakops --version
   ```
