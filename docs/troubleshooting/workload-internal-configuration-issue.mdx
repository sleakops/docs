# Internal Workload Configuration Issue

**Date:** March 28, 2025  
**Category:** Workload  
**Tags:** Workload, Internal, Configuration, UI, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users attempting to modify internal workload configurations through the SleakOps platform interface encounter UI navigation issues that prevent them from completing the configuration process.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- "Next" button in Service Schema step becomes unresponsive
- Unable to advance through configuration wizard for internal workloads
- Problem affects multiple internal workloads consistently
- Public workloads can be modified without issues
- Configuration changes cannot be saved or applied

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Workload type: Internal workloads
- Affected step: Service Schema configuration step
- UI component: Next button functionality
- Working alternative: Public workloads function normally

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs specifically with internal workload types
- Problem appears during Service Schema step of configuration wizard
- Affects all internal workloads uniformly
- Does not affect public workload configurations

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-workaround" summary="Immediate workaround using Lens">

While the platform UI issue is being resolved, you can modify internal workload configurations directly using Lens:

1. **Access your cluster through Lens**
2. **Navigate to Workloads** → **Deployments**
3. **Find your internal workload**
4. **Edit the deployment directly**

For common modifications:

```yaml
# To change replica count
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Change this value

# To modify resource limits
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-container
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "250m"
            memory: "256Mi"
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="kubectl-alternative" summary="Alternative using kubectl">

You can also use kubectl to modify internal workloads:

```bash
# Get current deployment configuration
kubectl get deployment <workload-name> -o yaml > workload-backup.yaml

# Edit the deployment
kubectl edit deployment <workload-name>

# Or apply changes from a file
kubectl apply -f modified-workload.yaml

# Verify changes
kubectl get deployment <workload-name>
kubectl describe deployment <workload-name>
```

**Scaling replicas:**

```bash
kubectl scale deployment <workload-name> --replicas=5
```

**Updating resource limits:**

```bash
kubectl patch deployment <workload-name> -p '{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "containers": [{
          "name": "<container-name>",
          "resources": {
            "limits": {
              "cpu": "1000m",
              "memory": "1Gi"
            },
            "requests": {
              "cpu": "500m",
              "memory": "512Mi"
            }
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

**Updating environment variables:**

```bash
kubectl set env deployment/<workload-name> NEW_VAR=new_value
```

**Rolling restart:**

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/<workload-name>
```

**Check rollout status:**

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/<workload-name>
```

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Monitor platform status:**

   - Check SleakOps status page for known issues
   - Subscribe to platform notifications
   - Join community channels for updates

2. **Maintain kubectl access:**

   - Keep local kubectl configuration updated
   - Ensure Lens is installed and configured
   - Document common commands for your team

3. **Backup configurations:**

   - Export workload configurations regularly
   - Keep local copies of important deployments
   - Version control your Kubernetes manifests

4. **Report UI issues:**
   - Contact SleakOps support when encountering UI problems
   - Provide detailed reproduction steps
   - Include browser and platform version information
