# Deployment Stuck in Pending State

**Date:** December 28, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Deployment, Stuck, Troubleshooting, Build

## Problem Description

**Context:** User experiences a deployment that gets stuck in a pending state, preventing any new deployments from being created. The deployment pod is not created and builds remain in "starting" status indefinitely.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Deployment stuck in pending state without creating pods
- Cannot create new deployments for the same project
- Multiple builds stuck in "starting" status
- No error messages displayed in the UI
- Deployment appears to be blocking the entire deployment pipeline

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Environment: Production
- Project: Any project experiencing stuck deployments
- Build status: "Starting" (indefinitely)
- Deployment status: Pending/Stuck

**Error Conditions:**

- Occurs during deployment creation process
- Blocks subsequent deployment attempts
- Builds fail to progress beyond "starting" status
- No automatic recovery mechanism triggers

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-resolution" summary="Immediate resolution steps">

If you encounter a stuck deployment, contact the SleakOps support team immediately. The resolution typically involves:

1. **Task State Update**: Support team will identify tasks with outdated states
2. **Manual State Correction**: Update task states to reflect current reality
3. **Pipeline Unblocking**: Clear the deployment queue to allow new deployments

**Contact Information:**

- Email: support@sleakops.com
- Include your project name and deployment details

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention-measures" summary="Prevention and monitoring">

To minimize the occurrence of stuck deployments:

**Monitor Your Deployments:**

```bash
# Check deployment status regularly
sleakops deployment list --project your-project

# Monitor build progress
sleakops build list --status starting
```

**Set Reasonable Timeouts:**

- Configure appropriate build timeouts in your project settings
- Monitor long-running builds that may indicate issues

**Regular Health Checks:**

- Verify deployment pipeline health before critical releases
- Test deployments in staging environment first

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting-steps" summary="Self-diagnosis steps">

Before contacting support, try these diagnostic steps:

**1. Check Deployment Logs:**

```bash
sleakops deployment logs --deployment-id <deployment-id>
```

**2. Verify Resource Availability:**

- Check if your cluster has sufficient resources
- Verify node capacity and pod limits

**3. Review Build Logs:**

```bash
sleakops build logs --build-id <build-id>
```

**4. Check Project Status:**

```bash
sleakops project status --project <project-name>
```

**5. Verify Dependencies:**

- Ensure all required services are running
- Check database connectivity
- Verify external service availability

<TroubleshootingItem id="post-resolution" summary="Post-resolution verification">

After support resolves the issue:

**1. Verify Deployment Pipeline:**

```bash
# Test a simple deployment
sleakops deploy --project <project-name> --environment staging
```

**2. Check Build System:**

```bash
# Trigger a new build
sleakops build create --project <project-name>
```

**3. Monitor for Recurrence:**

- Watch subsequent deployments closely
- Report any similar issues immediately
- Document any patterns observed

**4. Update Monitoring:**

- Set up alerts for stuck deployments
- Configure notifications for long-running builds
