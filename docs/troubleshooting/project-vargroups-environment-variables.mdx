# Vargroups Environment Variables Not Available in Application

**Date:** December 30, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Vargroups, Environment Variables, Project, Configuration

## Problem Description

**Context:** User has created multiple Vargroups but their application is only receiving environment variables from one specific Vargroup ('simplee-web'), while other expected environment variables are missing.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Application only shows environment variables from one Vargroup
- Missing environment variables that should be available
- Other Vargroups appear to not be affecting the application
- Application may not be reading environment variables correctly from the Pod

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Application: Web application (simplee.cl)
- Available Vargroup: 'simplee-web'
- Platform: SleakOps project environment
- Missing: Additional Vargroups with required environment variables

**Error Conditions:**

- Environment variables from other Vargroups are not reaching the application
- Only one Vargroup's variables are being applied
- Application functionality may be impacted by missing variables

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="vargroup-scope" summary="Understanding Vargroup Project Scope">

Vargroups in SleakOps are **project-scoped**, meaning:

- Each Vargroup only affects the specific Project where it was created
- Vargroups from other Projects are not accessible
- You need to create all required Vargroups within the same Project

**To verify your current Vargroups:**

1. Navigate to your Project in SleakOps
2. Go to **Configuration** → **Vargroups**
3. Check which Vargroups exist in this specific Project

If you're missing Vargroups in your current Project:

1. **Navigate to Project Settings:**

   - Go to your Project dashboard
   - Select **Configuration** → **Vargroups**

2. **Create New Vargroup:**

   - Click **Add Vargroup**
   - Enter a descriptive name
   - Add all required environment variables

3. **Configure Variables:**

   ```bash
   # Example Vargroup configuration
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
   API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

4. **Apply Changes:**
   - Save the Vargroup
   - Redeploy your application to apply new variables

Ensure your application code is properly reading environment variables:

**For Node.js applications:**

```javascript
// Check if variables are available
console.log("Available env vars:", Object.keys(process.env));

// Access specific variables
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

**For Python applications:**

```python
import os

# Check available variables
print('Available env vars:', list(os.environ.keys()))

# Access specific variables
db_url = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
api_key = os.environ.get('API_KEY')
```

**Debug in Pod:**

```bash
# Connect to your pod and check environment
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- env | grep -i <variable-name>
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting-steps" summary="Troubleshooting Missing Variables">

**Step 1: Verify Vargroup Assignment**

- Ensure all required Vargroups are created in the correct Project
- Check that Vargroups are properly assigned to your application

**Step 2: Check Deployment Status**

- After creating new Vargroups, trigger a new deployment
- Environment variables are applied during deployment time

**Step 3: Validate Variable Names**

- Ensure variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check for typos in variable names

**Step 4: Application Code Review**

- Verify your application is reading from `process.env` or equivalent
- Check if variables are being used in the correct scope

**Step 5: Pod-level Verification**

```bash
# Check environment variables in the running pod
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- printenv
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="common-issues" summary="Common Issues and Solutions">

**Issue 1: Variables Not Updated After Changes**

- **Solution:** Redeploy the application after Vargroup changes
- Environment variables are injected at container startup

**Issue 2: Case Sensitivity**

- **Solution:** Ensure exact case matching between Vargroup and application code
- Linux containers are case-sensitive

**Issue 3: Variable Overriding**

- **Solution:** Check if multiple Vargroups define the same variable
- Later Vargroups may override earlier ones

**Issue 4: Application Not Reading Environment**

- **Solution:** Verify application framework properly loads environment variables
- Some frameworks require explicit configuration
