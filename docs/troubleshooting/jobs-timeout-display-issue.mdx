# Jobs Display Timeout Error Despite Successful Execution

**Date:** February 10, 2025  
**Category:** Workload  
**Tags:** Jobs, Timeout, UI, Display, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Long-running jobs in SleakOps that take several hours to complete are displaying timeout errors in the UI, even though they are executing successfully in the background.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Jobs show "Time Out" error status in the SleakOps dashboard
- Jobs are actually running and completing successfully
- The timeout error appears to be a display issue, not an actual execution failure
- Long-running jobs (several hours) are more likely to experience this issue

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Job type: Long-running batch jobs
- Execution time: Several hours
- Platform: SleakOps job management system
- Status display: Shows timeout error incorrectly

**Error Conditions:**

- Error appears in UI after extended execution time
- Jobs continue running despite timeout display
- Issue affects job status visibility and monitoring
- Problem occurs with jobs that exceed certain time thresholds

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="understanding-issue" summary="Understanding the timeout display issue">

This is a known UI display issue where:

1. **Jobs continue executing normally** in the background
2. **The UI timeout is cosmetic** - it doesn't affect actual job execution
3. **Job completion status** may not update correctly in real-time
4. **The underlying job infrastructure** continues working as expected

This is a platform-level issue that requires a fix from the SleakOps development team.

<TroubleshootingItem id="verification-steps" summary="How to verify your job is actually running">

To confirm your job is executing properly despite the timeout display:

1. **Check job logs directly:**

   ```bash
   # Access job logs through kubectl if available
   kubectl logs -f job/your-job-name
   ```

2. **Monitor resource usage:**

   - Check CPU/memory usage in the cluster
   - Verify if your job pods are still active

3. **Check job output:**

   - Monitor any output files or databases your job writes to
   - Verify intermediate results are being generated

4. **Use kubectl to check job status:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get jobs
   kubectl describe job your-job-name
   ```

While waiting for the platform fix, you can:

1. **Set up external monitoring:**

   ```yaml
   # Add health check endpoints to your job
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: long-running-job
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: worker
             image: your-image
             # Add periodic status updates
             command: ["/bin/sh"]
             args:
               [
                 "-c",
                 "your-job-command && echo 'Job completed successfully' > /tmp/status",
               ]
   ```

2. **Implement progress logging:**

   - Add regular progress updates to your job code
   - Use structured logging to track job phases
   - Consider using external status endpoints

3. **Use job completion notifications:**
   - Configure webhooks or notifications for job completion
   - Set up alerts for actual job failures vs. UI timeouts

<TroubleshootingItem id="best-practices" summary="Best practices for long-running jobs">

To minimize issues with long-running jobs:

1. **Implement checkpointing:**

   ```python
   # Example: Save progress periodically
   def save_checkpoint(progress_data):
       with open('/tmp/checkpoint.json', 'w') as f:
           json.dump(progress_data, f)

   def load_checkpoint():
       try:
           with open('/tmp/checkpoint.json', 'r') as f:
               return json.load(f)
       except FileNotFoundError:
           return None
   ```

2. **Break down large jobs:**

   - Consider splitting very long jobs into smaller chunks
   - Use job dependencies to chain smaller jobs together
   - Implement proper error handling and retry logic

3. **Add health checks:**
   ```yaml
   # Add liveness and readiness probes
   livenessProbe:
     exec:
       command:
         - /bin/sh
         - -c
         - "test -f /tmp/job-alive"
     initialDelaySeconds: 30
     periodSeconds: 60
   ```

<TroubleshootingItem id="platform-fix-timeline" summary="Expected platform fix timeline">

The SleakOps development team is aware of this issue and is working on a fix. The timeline includes:

1. **Short-term (few days):** Platform fix deployment
2. **Medium-term:** Enhanced job monitoring and status display
3. **Long-term:** Improved handling of long-running workloads

**What the fix will address:**

- Correct timeout handling for long-running jobs
- Improved UI status updates
- Better real-time job monitoring
- Enhanced job lifecycle management

**No action required from users** - the fix will be applied automatically to the platform.
