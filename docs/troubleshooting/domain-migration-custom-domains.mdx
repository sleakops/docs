# Domain Migration and Custom Domain Configuration

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Domain, Migration, DNS, Alias, Custom Domain

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to migrate their applications from one domain to another or configure custom domains for their SleakOps deployments.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Need to change application URLs from old domain to new domain
- Want to use newly acquired domain for existing applications
- Require guidance on DNS configuration for custom domains
- Need to understand migration options and their implications

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Current domain: `byroncode.com`
- New domain: `ordenapp.com.ar`
- Application: Frontend/landing page
- Platform: SleakOps execution environment

**Error Conditions:**

- Applications currently accessible only through old domain
- Need to transition without service disruption
- DNS records need manual configuration

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="domain-alias-option" summary="Adding Domain Alias (Quick Solution)">

For simple URL changes without full migration, you can add a domain alias to your existing execution:

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to your execution in the SleakOps dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **Domain Configuration**
3. Click **Add Alias**
4. Enter your new domain (e.g., `ordenapp.com.ar`)
5. Save the configuration

**DNS Configuration:**
After creating the alias, you'll receive DNS records that need to be manually added to your domain registrar:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [provided-by-sleakops].sleakops.io

Type: A
Name: @
Value: [IP-address-provided]
```

**Benefits:**

- Quick implementation
- No service disruption
- Maintains existing configuration
- Both domains work simultaneously

<TroubleshootingItem id="full-migration-option" summary="Full Domain Migration">

For complete migration of all services from the old domain to the new one:

**Prerequisites:**

- Coordinate with SleakOps support team
- Schedule maintenance window
- Backup current configuration

**Migration Process:**

1. **Pre-migration planning:**

   - Document all current services and configurations
   - Identify dependencies
   - Plan rollback strategy

2. **Domain configuration:**

   - Update primary domain in project settings
   - Reconfigure SSL certificates
   - Update environment variables

3. **DNS updates:**

   - Point new domain to SleakOps infrastructure
   - Update all subdomains
   - Configure proper TTL values

4. **Testing and validation:**
   - Verify all services are accessible
   - Test SSL certificate validity
   - Confirm all integrations work

**Note:** This option requires coordination with the SleakOps team and may involve service downtime.

<TroubleshootingItem id="new-environment-approach" summary="Creating New Environment with Custom Domain">

With the latest SleakOps version, you can create new environments with custom URLs:

**When to use:**

- For development environments
- When you want a fresh start
- For testing new domain configuration

**Steps:**

1. Create a new environment in SleakOps
2. During setup, specify your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as provided
4. Deploy your application to the new environment

**Considerations:**

- Dependencies need to be recreated
- Database migrations may be required
- Environment variables need reconfiguration
- Suitable mainly for development environments

```yaml
# Example environment configuration
environment:
  name: "production-new-domain"
  domain: "ordenapp.com.ar"
  ssl: true
  auto_deploy: true
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="dns-configuration-guide" summary="DNS Configuration Guide">

**Common DNS Records for SleakOps:**

```
# Root domain
Type: A
Name: @
Value: [IP provided by SleakOps]
TTL: 300

# WWW subdomain
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [hostname].sleakops.io
TTL: 300

# API subdomain (if applicable)
Type: CNAME
Name: api
Value: [api-hostname].sleakops.io
TTL: 300
```

**DNS Propagation:**

- Changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- Use tools like `dig` or online DNS checkers to verify
- Lower TTL values speed up changes but increase DNS queries

**Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Check A record
dig ordenapp.com.ar A

# Check CNAME record
dig www.ordenapp.com.ar CNAME

# Check from specific DNS server
dig @8.8.8.8 ordenapp.com.ar
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="best-practices" summary="Best Practices and Recommendations">

**For Production Environments:**

1. **Use domain aliases first** - Test the new domain alongside the old one
2. **Plan maintenance windows** - For full migrations, schedule during low-traffic periods
3. **Monitor after changes** - Watch for SSL certificate issues and DNS propagation
4. **Keep old domain active** - Maintain redirects for SEO and user experience

**SSL Certificate Considerations:**

- SleakOps automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains
- Certificate generation may take 5-10 minutes
- Ensure DNS records are correct before SSL provisioning

**Rollback Strategy:**

- Keep original DNS records documented
- Have a plan to revert changes quickly
- Test rollback procedure in development first

**Communication:**

- Notify users of domain changes in advance
- Update documentation and links
- Configure proper redirects from old to new domain
