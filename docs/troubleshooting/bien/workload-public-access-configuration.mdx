# Workload Public Access Configuration

**Date:** March 18, 2025  
**Category:** Workload  
**Tags:** Workload, Public Access, VPN, Configuration, Staging

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to access staging environments without being connected to VPN, but workloads are configured for private access by default in SleakOps.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Staging workload is only accessible when connected to VPN
- Team members cannot access staging environment without VPN connection
- Need to make workload publicly accessible for broader team access

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Environment: Staging
- Access method: Currently VPN-only
- Desired access: Public internet access
- Platform: SleakOps workload management

**Error Conditions:**

- Workload inaccessible without VPN connection
- Connection timeouts when accessing from public internet
- Need to modify workload configuration for public access

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="workload-public-configuration" summary="How to configure workload for public access">

To make a workload publicly accessible in SleakOps:

1. **Navigate to your project** in the SleakOps dashboard
2. **Select the workload** you want to make public
3. **Go to workload settings** or configuration
4. **Find the network/access configuration section**
5. **Change the access type** from "Private" to "Public"
6. **Save and redeploy** the workload

The workload will now be accessible from the public internet without requiring VPN connection.

<TroubleshootingItem id="access-types-explanation" summary="Understanding workload access types">

**Private Access (Default):**

- Workload is only accessible through VPN
- Higher security for internal applications
- Requires VPN connection for all access

**Public Access:**

- Workload is accessible from the public internet
- Suitable for staging environments and public-facing applications
- No VPN connection required
- Should be used with proper authentication and security measures

<TroubleshootingItem id="security-considerations" summary="Security considerations for public workloads">

When making workloads publicly accessible:

1. **Enable authentication**: Ensure your application has proper login mechanisms
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always enable SSL/TLS for public workloads
3. **Implement rate limiting**: Protect against abuse and DDoS attacks
4. **Monitor access logs**: Keep track of who is accessing your application
5. **Regular security updates**: Keep your application and dependencies updated

```yaml
# Example workload configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: staging-app
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer # For public access
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  selector:
    app: staging-app
```

If you're still having issues after making the workload public:

1. **Check DNS propagation**: It may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate
2. **Verify load balancer status**: Ensure the load balancer is properly configured
3. **Check security groups**: Verify that necessary ports are open
4. **Review application logs**: Look for any application-specific errors
5. **Test from different networks**: Verify access from multiple locations

**Common commands for troubleshooting:**

```bash
# Check service status
kubectl get services

# Check ingress configuration
kubectl get ingress

# View workload logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/your-workload-name
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="staging-vs-production" summary="Best practices for staging vs production access">

**Staging Environments:**

- Can be made public for team collaboration
- Should still have basic authentication
- Consider IP whitelisting for additional security

**Production Environments:**

- Evaluate carefully before making public
- Implement comprehensive security measures
- Use proper monitoring and alerting
- Consider gradual rollout strategies
