<TroubleshootingItem id="upgrade-management" summary="Who Manages the Upgrades">

SleakOps handles all EKS cluster upgrades:

- **Automatic Management**: SleakOps team manages and executes all upgrades
- **No Manual Intervention**: Users do not need to perform manual upgrades through AWS Console
- **Pre-testing**: Extensive testing is performed before production upgrades
- **Monitoring**: SleakOps team monitors the upgrade process

**On-Demand Upgrades:**
In some cases, SleakOps provides a workflow within the platform for users to trigger upgrades on-demand when needed.

<TroubleshootingItem id="upgrade-preparation" summary="How to Prepare for Upgrades">

**Before Upgrades:**

1. **Review Applications**: Ensure your applications are compatible with the target Kubernetes version
2. **Backup Critical Data**: Although managed by SleakOps, ensure your application data is backed up
3. **Monitor Communications**: Watch for upgrade notifications from SleakOps
4. **Avoid Manual Changes**: Do not make manual modifications to the cluster before upgrades

**During Upgrades:**

1. **Stay Available**: Be available to respond to any issues
2. **Monitor Applications**: Check application health after upgrade completion
3. **Report Issues**: Contact SleakOps immediately if problems arise

**After Upgrades:**

1. **Verify Functionality**: Test critical application features
2. **Check Logs**: Review application and system logs for any issues
3. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure application dependencies are compatible with new Kubernetes version

**Current Upgrade Path:**

```
Current: 1.29 → Target: 1.32
Upgrade sequence: 1.29 → 1.30 → 1.31 → 1.32
```

**Compatibility Considerations:**

- Each version upgrade maintains backward compatibility for most features
- Deprecated APIs may be removed in newer versions
- Custom resources and operators should be verified for compatibility
- Third-party integrations may require updates

**Best Practices:**

- Keep applications updated to use current Kubernetes APIs
- Avoid using deprecated features
- Test applications in development environments with newer Kubernetes versions
- Follow Kubernetes deprecation policies
