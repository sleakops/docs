# Web Service Domain Reset During Replica Update

**Date:** February 20, 2025  
**Category:** Workload  
**Tags:** WebService, Domain, Replicas, Frontend, Configuration

## Problem Description

**Context:** When editing a Web Service configuration to modify replica count, the domain name unexpectedly changes from the current production domain to the default project name, causing potential downtime.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Domain name resets to project name when editing Web Service
- Occurs when making simple changes like replica count updates
- Causes temporary website downtime if not noticed immediately
- Frontend shows project name instead of current production domain

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Component: Web Service configuration
- Action: Editing replica count
- Expected behavior: Domain should remain unchanged
- Actual behavior: Domain resets to project name

**Error Conditions:**

- Occurs during Web Service editing process
- Happens when modifying any Web Service parameter
- Results in unintended domain changes
- Can cause service interruption

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-workaround" summary="Immediate workaround to prevent downtime">

To avoid accidental domain changes when editing Web Services:

1. **Always verify the domain field** before saving changes
2. **Check that the domain matches your current production URL**
3. **If the domain has reset, manually correct it** to your production domain
4. **Save the configuration** only after verifying all fields

**Important:** Always double-check the domain field even when making unrelated changes like replica count adjustments.

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="current-behavior" summary="Understanding the current behavior">

Currently, the Web Service edit form may display the project name as the default domain instead of preserving the existing production domain. This is a known frontend issue that can cause:

- Unexpected domain changes
- Service interruptions
- Need for manual domain correction
- Potential downtime if not caught immediately

<TroubleshootingItem id="best-practices" summary="Best practices when editing Web Services">

To minimize risk when editing Web Services:

1. **Review all fields** before saving, not just the ones you intended to change
2. **Take note of your current domain** before starting the edit process
3. **Make changes during maintenance windows** when possible
4. **Have monitoring in place** to quickly detect domain changes
5. **Consider making changes in smaller batches** to limit impact

<TroubleshootingItem id="monitoring-setup" summary="Setting up monitoring to detect domain changes">

To quickly detect if your domain has been accidentally changed:

1. **Set up external monitoring** for your production URLs
2. **Configure alerts** for HTTP response changes
3. **Monitor DNS resolution** for your domains
4. **Use health checks** that verify the correct service is responding

```bash
# Example monitoring script
curl -f https://your-production-domain.com/health || echo "Domain issue detected"
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="recovery-steps" summary="Steps to recover from accidental domain change">

If you've accidentally changed the domain:

1. **Immediately edit the Web Service again**
2. **Correct the domain field** to your production domain
3. **Save the configuration**
4. **Wait for the deployment to complete**
5. **Verify the service is accessible** at the correct URL
6. **Check that all traffic is routing correctly**

The recovery process typically takes a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
