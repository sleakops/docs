# Build Pods Stuck in Creation State

**Date:** March 22, 2025  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Build, Pods, Deployment, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** User experiences builds that remain stuck in an incomplete state, with pods that never finish creating and are not visible in the interface.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Builds appear "bugged" or stuck
- Pods are not visible in the interface
- Pods never complete their creation process
- Issue persists for extended periods (12+ hours)
- Build process appears frozen

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Platform: SleakOps
- Build system: Kubernetes-based builds
- Duration: Extended periods without resolution
- User interface: Pods not appearing in dashboard

**Error Conditions:**

- Builds initiated but never complete
- Pod creation process hangs indefinitely
- No visible progress in build status
- Issue requires manual intervention to resolve

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="initial-diagnosis" summary="Diagnosing stuck build pods">

When builds get stuck with pods not appearing, this typically indicates:

1. **Resource constraints**: Insufficient cluster resources to schedule pods
2. **Image pull issues**: Problems downloading container images
3. **Node scheduling problems**: Pods cannot be assigned to available nodes
4. **Persistent volume issues**: Storage-related problems preventing pod startup
5. **Network connectivity**: Issues with cluster networking

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-troubleshooting" summary="Immediate troubleshooting steps">

To diagnose and resolve stuck build pods:

**Step 1: Check cluster resources**

```bash
# Check node resources
kubectl top nodes

# Check pod status in build namespace
kubectl get pods -n <build-namespace> --show-labels

# Describe stuck pods for detailed information
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <build-namespace>
```

**Step 2: Check for pending pods**

```bash
# List all pending pods
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --field-selector=status.phase=Pending

# Check events for scheduling issues
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="common-solutions" summary="Common solutions for stuck builds">

**Solution 1: Restart stuck builds**

In SleakOps dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Projects** → **Your Project**
2. Go to **Builds** section
3. Find the stuck build
4. Click **Cancel Build**
5. Start a new build

**Solution 2: Clear build cache**

If builds consistently get stuck:

1. Go to **Project Settings**
2. Navigate to **Build Configuration**
3. Enable **"Clear build cache"** option
4. Trigger a new build

**Solution 3: Check resource limits**

Verify your project's resource allocation:

```yaml
# Example resource configuration
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "1000m"
```

**Best practices to avoid stuck builds:**

1. **Monitor resource usage**:

   - Regularly check cluster resource consumption
   - Set appropriate resource requests and limits
   - Monitor build queue length

2. **Optimize build configuration**:

   - Use smaller base images when possible
   - Implement proper build caching strategies
   - Set reasonable build timeouts

3. **Regular maintenance**:
   - Periodically clean up old builds
   - Monitor and clean unused Docker images
   - Keep build environments updated

**Example build configuration:**

```yaml
build:
  timeout: 30m
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 1Gi
      cpu: 500m
  cache:
    enabled: true
    ttl: 24h
```

Contact SleakOps support if:

- Builds remain stuck after trying the above solutions
- Multiple projects are affected simultaneously
- The issue persists for more than 2 hours
- You see cluster-wide resource issues

**Information to provide when contacting support:**

- Project name and build ID
- Duration of the issue
- Recent changes to build configuration
- Screenshots of stuck build status
- Any error messages from build logs
