# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Not Triggering

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** GitHub, CI/CD, Deployment, Troubleshooting, Pipeline

## Problem Description

**Context:** User experiences issues with continuous integration pipeline in SleakOps where GitHub Actions workflows stop triggering automatic builds and deployments after pushing to the development branch.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Push to development branch no longer triggers automatic builds
- Previously working CI/CD pipeline has stopped functioning
- No visible workflow execution in GitHub Actions
- Deployments are not being created automatically

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Repository: GitHub
- Branch: dev (development branch)
- Project: mx-simplee-web
- Pipeline: GitHub Actions with YAML configuration
- Platform: SleakOps integration

**Error Conditions:**

- Pipeline worked previously but stopped suddenly
- No apparent changes to YAML configuration file
- Push events are not triggering workflow execution
- No error messages visible in repository

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="initial-diagnosis" summary="Check GitHub Actions workflow status">

First, verify the current status of your GitHub Actions workflows:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. Look for the latest workflow runs
4. Check if workflows are:
   - Not being triggered at all
   - Failing during execution
   - Queued but not running

This will help identify whether the issue is with triggering or execution.

<TroubleshootingItem id="yaml-verification" summary="Verify YAML configuration file">

Even if you haven't changed the YAML file recently, verify its current state:

1. Check the workflow file location: `.github/workflows/[workflow-name].yml`
2. Verify the trigger configuration:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [dev, main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [dev, main]
```

3. Ensure the branch name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Check for any syntax errors using a YAML validator

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="branch-protection" summary="Check branch protection rules">

Branch protection rules can prevent workflows from running:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** in your repository
2. Check if there are protection rules on your `dev` branch
3. Ensure "Restrict pushes that create files" is not blocking your workflow
4. Verify that required status checks aren't preventing execution

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="permissions-check" summary="Verify repository permissions">

Check if GitHub Actions has the necessary permissions:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Ensure "Actions permissions" is set to allow workflows
3. Check "Workflow permissions" - should be "Read and write permissions"
4. Verify that "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled if needed

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="sleakops-integration" summary="Verify SleakOps integration">

Check the integration between GitHub and SleakOps:

1. In SleakOps dashboard, go to your project settings
2. Verify the connected repository URL is correct
3. Check that the target branch is set to `dev`
4. Ensure the webhook is still active in GitHub:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks** in your repository
   - Look for SleakOps webhook and verify it's active
   - Check recent deliveries for any failed requests

<TroubleshootingItem id="workflow-recreation" summary="Recreate workflow if necessary">

If the issue persists, try recreating the workflow:

1. Create a new branch from `dev`
2. Make a small change to trigger the workflow
3. Create a simple test workflow:

```yaml
name: Test CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [dev]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Test
        run: echo "Workflow is working"
```

4. Push the changes and verify the workflow triggers
5. If successful, gradually add back your original workflow steps

<TroubleshootingItem id="common-fixes" summary="Common fixes that resolve the issue">

Based on common scenarios, try these solutions:

1. **Re-push to trigger**: Make a small commit and push again
2. **Check quotas**: Ensure you haven't exceeded GitHub Actions minutes
3. **Restart workflows**: Cancel any stuck workflows and retry
4. **Update checkout action**: Use the latest version `actions/checkout@v4`
5. **Clear cache**: Delete workflow caches if they're corrupted

```bash
# Force trigger workflow with empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger workflow"
git push origin dev
```
