# Connecting to Kubernetes Cluster with Lens IDE

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Category:** Cluster  
**Tags:** Lens, Kubernetes, IDE, Connection, kubectl

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to connect to their SleakOps Kubernetes cluster from their local development environment to monitor workloads, debug issues, and manage resources.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Need to access cluster resources from local machine
- Want to use a visual interface instead of command line only
- Require ability to view pods, logs, and workload status
- Need to troubleshoot deployment issues

**Relevant Configuration:**

- SleakOps cluster with connection data available
- Local development machine
- Kubernetes IDE preference (Lens recommended)
- kubectl CLI as alternative option

**Use Cases:**

- Monitoring pod status and logs
- Debugging deployment issues
- Managing Kubernetes resources visually
- Troubleshooting application health checks

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="lens-overview" summary="What is Lens IDE and why use it">

Lens is a Kubernetes IDE that provides a visual interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It's recommended by SleakOps because it offers:

- **Visual cluster management**: Easy-to-use graphical interface
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live view of pods, services, and deployments
- **Log aggregation**: Centralized log viewing from multiple pods
- **Resource management**: Create, edit, and delete Kubernetes resources
- **Multi-cluster support**: Connect to multiple clusters simultaneously

**Alternatives:**

- kubectl CLI (command-line interface)
- Other Kubernetes IDEs (k9s, Octant, etc.)
- Cloud provider consoles

<TroubleshootingItem id="connection-prerequisites" summary="Step 1: Install required dependencies">

Before connecting to your cluster, ensure you have these 4 dependencies installed on your local machine:

1. **Lens IDE**: Download from [k8slens.dev](https://k8slens.dev)
2. **kubectl**: Kubernetes command-line tool
3. **AWS CLI**: For AWS authentication (if using AWS)
4. **Docker**: Container runtime (optional but recommended)

### Installation Commands

**macOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
# Install kubectl
brew install kubectl

# Install AWS CLI
brew install awscli

# Install Docker Desktop
brew install --cask docker
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Install AWS CLI
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

**Windows:**

- Download Lens from the official website
- Install kubectl using chocolatey: `choco install kubernetes-cli`
- Install AWS CLI from AWS documentation

<TroubleshootingItem id="authentication-setup" summary="Step 2: Authenticate and get credentials">

To connect to your SleakOps cluster, you need to authenticate and obtain the necessary credentials:

1. **Access SleakOps Dashboard**: Log into your SleakOps account
2. **Navigate to Cluster**: Go to your specific cluster
3. **Find Connection Data**: Look for "Connection Data" in the cluster options
4. **Get AWS Credentials**: Follow the provided link to obtain:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Session Token (if using temporary credentials)

### Configure AWS Credentials

```bash
# Configure AWS CLI with your credentials
aws configure
# Enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and region

# Or set environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-session-token"  # if applicable
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="kubeconfig-setup" summary="Step 3: Copy and configure kubeconfig">

The kubeconfig file contains the cluster connection information:

1. **Get kubeconfig YAML**: Copy the kubeconfig YAML from the SleakOps connection data
2. **Save to file**: Save it to your local kubeconfig file

### Method 1: Direct file replacement

```bash
# Backup existing kubeconfig (if any)
cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.backup

# Create the .kube directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.kube

# Save the new kubeconfig
# Paste the YAML content from SleakOps into ~/.kube/config
```

### Method 2: Merge with existing config

```bash
# If you have multiple clusters, merge configurations
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/path/to/sleakops-config.yaml
kubectl config view --flatten > ~/.kube/config.new
mv ~/.kube/config.new ~/.kube/config
```

### Verify connection

```bash
# Test the connection
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="lens-connection" summary="Connecting with Lens IDE">

Once you have the kubeconfig configured:

1. **Open Lens IDE**
2. **Add Cluster**: Click on "+" or "Add Cluster"
3. **Paste kubeconfig**: Paste the YAML content from SleakOps
4. **Connect**: Lens will automatically detect and connect to your cluster

### Navigating in Lens

- **Workloads → Pods**: View all pods in your cluster
- **Workloads → Deployments**: Manage your deployments
- **Network → Services**: View and manage services
- **Storage**: Manage persistent volumes and claims
- **Namespaces**: Your project environment will appear as `project-name-environment`

### Finding Your Application

Your application pods will be in a namespace following this pattern:

```
[project-name]-[environment-name]
```

For example: `myapp-production` or `myapp-staging`
