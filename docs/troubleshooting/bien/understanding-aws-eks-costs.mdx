# Understanding AWS EKS Costs in SleakOps

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Category:** Cluster  
**Tags:** EKS, AWS, Costs, Billing, NodeGroup

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users often have questions about AWS EKS cluster costs when using SleakOps, particularly understanding the different cost categories and what generates charges even during development or testing phases.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Unexpected charges for EKS clusters during development
- Confusion about different AWS cost categories
- Questions about why costs occur even with minimal usage
- Difficulty understanding the relationship between cluster components and billing

**Relevant Configuration:**

- AWS EKS cluster with control plane
- NodeGroups for worker nodes
- Karpenter for auto-scaling
- Various add-ons and applications deployed

**Error Conditions:**

- Users see charges they don't understand
- Development environments generating unexpected costs
- Difficulty correlating usage with billing

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="eks-base-cost" summary="Understanding EKS Base Costs">

The **Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes** charge is the base cost of running an EKS cluster:

- **Fixed cost**: $73 USD per month per cluster
- **What it covers**: The EKS control plane (master nodes)
- **Always charged**: This cost applies regardless of workload usage
- **Prorated**: If your cluster exists for part of a month, you pay proportionally

**Example**: If your cluster runs from December 10th to December 31st (21 days), you pay approximately $51 USD (21/31 × $73).

For detailed pricing information, visit the [official AWS EKS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/).

<TroubleshootingItem id="compute-costs" summary="Understanding Compute Costs (EC2)">

The **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** charges cover the worker nodes that run your applications:

**NodeGroups**:

- EC2 instances that form your cluster's worker nodes
- Charged based on instance type and running time
- Examples: t3.medium, t3.large, m5.xlarge

**Karpenter-managed instances**:

- Automatically provisioned instances based on workload demands
- Scales up when applications need resources
- Scales down when resources are no longer needed

**Cost factors**:

- Instance type (CPU, memory, network performance)
- Number of instances
- Running time
- Data transfer

<TroubleshootingItem id="development-costs" summary="Managing Development Environment Costs">

Even development environments incur costs because:

1. **Control plane is always running**: The $73/month EKS charge applies
2. **Minimum worker nodes**: Usually need at least 1-2 nodes for basic functionality
3. **Add-ons consume resources**: Monitoring, logging, and other tools need compute power
4. **Background processes**: System pods and services run continuously

**Cost optimization strategies**:

```yaml
# Example cost-optimized development configuration
nodegroup_config:
  instance_types: ["t3.small", "t3.medium"]
  min_size: 1
  max_size: 3
  desired_size: 1

karpenter_config:
  enabled: true
  spot_instances: true # Use spot instances for cost savings

scheduling:
  auto_shutdown: "18:00" # Shut down non-essential workloads
  auto_startup: "09:00" # Start workloads during work hours
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="cost-monitoring" summary="Monitoring and Controlling Costs">

**In AWS Console**:

1. Go to **Cost Explorer**
2. Filter by service: **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service**
3. Group by: **Service** and **Usage Type**
4. Set up **Budget Alerts** for unexpected cost increases

**In SleakOps**:

- Monitor cluster resource usage in the dashboard
- Review deployed applications and their resource requests
- Use the cluster scaling settings to control maximum resources

**Best practices**:

- Use spot instances for development workloads
- Implement cluster autoscaling
- Regularly review and clean up unused resources
- Consider cluster hibernation for non-production environments

<TroubleshootingItem id="cost-breakdown-example" summary="Typical Cost Breakdown Example">

For a small development cluster running for a full month:

**Fixed costs**:

- EKS Control Plane: $73.00

**Variable costs**:

- 2 × t3.medium nodes (24/7): ~$60.00
- Additional Karpenter instances (occasional): ~$15.00
- Data transfer and storage: ~$5.00

**Total estimated monthly cost**: ~$153.00

**For partial month usage** (like December 10-31):

- EKS Control Plane: $51.00 (prorated)
- Compute resources: $34.00 (prorated)
- **Total**: ~$85.00

These are typical costs for a development environment with minimal but continuous usage.
