# VarGroup Data Loss and Recovery

**Date:** February 26, 2025  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** VarGroup, Data Loss, Recovery, Backup, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users may experience VarGroup data loss due to system bugs, accidental deletions, or deployment failures. This can result in environment variables being reverted to older versions or completely lost.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- VarGroup shows older version instead of latest configuration
- Missing environment variables in specific environments
- Variables that were previously configured are no longer available
- Deployment failures due to missing required variables
- Duplicate VarGroups appearing in the system

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Environment: Development, staging, or production
- VarGroup type: Global or environment-specific
- Last known working timestamp
- User permissions and access levels

**Error Conditions:**

- Data loss occurs after system bugs or maintenance
- Variables revert to previous versions unexpectedly
- Failed deployments trigger VarGroup corruption
- Duplicate VarGroups cause configuration conflicts

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-assessment" summary="Immediate Assessment Steps">

When VarGroup data loss is detected:

1. **Document the timeline**: Note when the issue was first observed
2. **Identify affected environments**: Check which environments are impacted
3. **Review recent changes**: Look at deployment history and user activities
4. **Check VarGroup history**: Review the update timeline in the admin panel

```bash
# Example of checking recent deployments
kubectl get deployments -n your-namespace --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="recovery-options" summary="Available Recovery Options">

**Option 1: Platform Recovery (If Available)**

- Contact SleakOps support immediately
- Provide the exact timestamp of the last known good configuration
- Include the VarGroup name and affected environment

**Option 2: Manual Recreation**

- Recreate the VarGroup from scratch
- Use documentation or team knowledge to restore variables
- Test thoroughly in development before applying to production

**Option 3: Version Control Recovery**

- If you maintain VarGroup configurations in version control
- Restore from your latest backup or commit
- Apply the configuration through the SleakOps interface

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention-measures" summary="Prevention and Best Practices">

**Backup Strategies:**

1. **Export VarGroups regularly**:

   ```bash
   # Export current VarGroup configuration
   sleakops vargroup export --name global --environment develop > vargroup-backup.json
   ```

2. **Version Control Integration**:

   - Store VarGroup configurations in Git repositories
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approaches
   - Implement automated backups

3. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain updated documentation of all environment variables
   - Document the purpose and expected values of each variable
   - Keep a changelog of VarGroup modifications

**Monitoring and Alerts:**

- Set up alerts for VarGroup changes
- Monitor deployment failures that might indicate missing variables
- Regular audits of VarGroup configurations

When deployments fail due to VarGroup issues:

1. **Check deployment logs**:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs deployment/your-app -n your-namespace
   ```

2. **Verify VarGroup content**:

   - Log into SleakOps admin panel
   - Navigate to VarGroups section
   - Compare current configuration with expected values

3. **Test variable availability**:

   ```bash
   # Test if variables are properly injected
   kubectl exec -it pod/your-pod -- env | grep YOUR_VARIABLE
   ```

4. **Rollback if necessary**:
   - Use previous working deployment
   - Restore VarGroup to last known good state
   - Redeploy after verification
