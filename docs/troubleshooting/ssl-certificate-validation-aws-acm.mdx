# SSL Certificate Validation Error in AWS ACM

**Date:** November 7, 2024  
**Category:** Provider  
**Tags:** AWS, ACM, SSL, Certificate, DNS, Validation

## Problem Description

**Context:** When deploying applications with custom domains in SleakOps, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates may fail to validate if the DNS validation is not completed within 72 hours of certificate creation.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- ACM certificate shows "Failed" or "Validation timed out" status
- Domain aliases cannot be properly configured
- SSL/TLS connections fail for the custom domain
- Certificate appears as "erroneous" in AWS console
- Applications may be inaccessible via HTTPS on custom domains

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Certificate type: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- Validation method: DNS validation
- Domain: Custom domain with external DNS management
- Time limit: 72 hours from certificate creation

**Error Conditions:**

- Certificate validation not completed within 72-hour window
- DNS TXT records not properly configured
- Domain ownership not verified through DNS
- Certificate regeneration required

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="certificate-regeneration" summary="Regenerate the failed ACM certificate">

When an ACM certificate fails validation, you need to regenerate it:

1. **Access your SleakOps execution dashboard**
2. **Navigate to the affected execution** (e.g., your landing page or web application)
3. **Go to the SSL/Certificate section**
4. **Click "Regenerate Certificate"** or similar option
5. **Wait for the new certificate to be created**

SleakOps will automatically create a new ACM certificate with fresh validation records.

<TroubleshootingItem id="dns-validation-setup" summary="Configure DNS validation records">

After regenerating the certificate, you must add DNS validation records:

1. **Copy the validation information** from your SleakOps execution details:

   - **Name**: `_[validation-hash].yourdomain.com`
   - **Value**: `_[validation-value].acm-validations.aws.`
   - **Type**: `TXT`

2. **Add the TXT record to your DNS provider**:

   ```
   Name: _595d6ebeeb98358afc0357d079d068f4.yourdomain.com
   Type: TXT
   Value: _139389a2dc765df9b1c6bc66a1367077.djqtsrsxkq.acm-validations.aws.
   TTL: 300 (or your provider's minimum)
   ```

3. **Save the DNS record** and wait for propagation (usually 5-15 minutes)

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="validation-verification" summary="Verify certificate validation">

After adding the DNS records:

1. **Wait for DNS propagation** (5-15 minutes typically)
2. **Use the "Check Certificate" button** in SleakOps to manually trigger validation
3. **Monitor the certificate status** in your execution dashboard
4. **Verify DNS record propagation** using tools like:
   ```bash
   dig TXT _595d6ebeeb98358afc0357d079d068f4.yourdomain.com
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   nslookup -type=TXT _595d6ebeeb98358afc0357d079d068f4.yourdomain.com
   ```

**Expected result**: Certificate status should change to "Issued" or "Valid"

<TroubleshootingItem id="common-dns-issues" summary="Troubleshoot common DNS validation issues">

**If validation continues to fail, check these common issues:**

1. **Incorrect DNS record format**:

   - Ensure the TXT record name includes the full validation subdomain
   - Don't add extra quotes around the value
   - Use the exact values provided by AWS/SleakOps

2. **DNS propagation delays**:

   - Some DNS providers take longer to propagate changes
   - Wait up to 1 hour before considering it failed
   - Check with multiple DNS lookup tools

3. **Multiple validation records**:

   - Remove any old/duplicate validation records
   - Only keep the current validation record

4. **DNS provider limitations**:
   - Some providers don't support long TXT record names
   - Contact your DNS provider if records aren't saving properly

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention-tips" summary="Prevent future certificate validation issues">

**To avoid certificate validation timeouts:**

1. **Set up DNS records immediately** after certificate creation
2. **Monitor certificate status** regularly in SleakOps dashboard
3. **Use automated DNS providers** when possible (Route53, Cloudflare API)
4. **Set calendar reminders** for certificate renewals
5. **Test DNS changes** before applying them to production domains

**Best practices:**

- Complete DNS validation within 24 hours of certificate creation
- Keep DNS management credentials accessible to your team
- Document your DNS validation process for future reference
