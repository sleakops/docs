# Production Build Failure with Log Loading Issues

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Build, Production, Logs, Deployment, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Production build process has stopped working and when attempting to view error logs through the SleakOps dashboard, the loading indicator appears indefinitely without displaying the actual logs.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Production build process fails to complete
- SleakOps dashboard shows perpetual loading when trying to access build logs
- Unable to view error details to diagnose the build failure
- Build worked previously but suddenly stopped functioning

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Environment: Production
- Platform: SleakOps
- Issue type: Build failure + Log access problem
- Status: Both build and log viewing are affected

**Error Conditions:**

- Build failure occurs during production deployment
- Log loading gets stuck in loading state
- Problem prevents proper troubleshooting
- Issue appeared suddenly after previously working builds

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-diagnosis" summary="Initial troubleshooting steps">

When facing both build failures and log loading issues, follow this diagnostic approach:

1. **Check build status**: Verify if the build is actually running or completely failed
2. **Browser refresh**: Try refreshing the SleakOps dashboard
3. **Different browser**: Test log access from an incognito window or different browser
4. **Network connectivity**: Ensure stable internet connection

If the dashboard logs won't load, try these alternatives:

**Via CLI (if available):**

```bash
# Check recent builds
sleakops builds list --project your-project-name

# Get specific build logs
sleakops builds logs --build-id <build-id>
```

**Via API:**

```bash
# Get build information
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.sleakops.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/builds
```

**Check email notifications:**

- Review any build failure emails that might contain error details

Typical reasons for sudden production build failures:

**Resource Issues:**

- Insufficient memory or CPU during build
- Disk space exhaustion
- Build timeout exceeded

**Configuration Changes:**

- Environment variables modified or missing
- Dockerfile changes that broke the build
- Dependency version conflicts

**External Dependencies:**

- Package registry issues (npm, pip, etc.)
- Base image unavailability
- Network connectivity problems

**Code Issues:**

- Recent commits that introduced build-breaking changes
- Missing files or incorrect file paths
- Compilation errors

When SleakOps dashboard logs won't load:

**Browser-related fixes:**

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Disable browser extensions temporarily
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Update your browser to the latest version

**Dashboard-specific solutions:**

1. Log out and log back into SleakOps
2. Check if other dashboard sections work properly
3. Try accessing from a different device
4. Wait a few minutes and retry (temporary server issues)

**If problem persists:**

- Contact SleakOps support with specific build ID
- Provide browser console errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Include screenshot of the loading issue

To get your production builds working again:

**1. Identify the last working build:**

```bash
# Find recent successful builds
sleakops builds list --status success --limit 5
```

**2. Compare configurations:**

- Check what changed between working and failing builds
- Review recent commits and configuration updates
- Verify environment variables haven't changed

**3. Rollback if necessary:**

```bash
# Deploy from last known good build
sleakops deploy --build-id <last-working-build-id>
```

**4. Test with minimal changes:**

- Try building with a simple change first
- Gradually add complexity to identify the breaking point

To avoid similar problems:

**Monitoring:**

- Set up build failure notifications
- Monitor build duration trends
- Track resource usage during builds

**Best practices:**

- Test builds in staging before production
- Use dependency version pinning
- Implement build caching strategies
- Regular backup of working configurations

**Documentation:**

- Document build dependencies and requirements
- Keep track of working environment configurations
- Maintain rollback procedures
