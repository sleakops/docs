# GitHub Automatic Deployments Not Working

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** GitHub, Deployment, Automation, CI/CD, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Automatic deployments from GitHub repositories have stopped working in SleakOps platform, preventing code changes from being automatically deployed to the target environment.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Automatic deployments from GitHub are not triggering
- Error messages appearing in deployment logs
- Code changes pushed to repository are not reflected in deployed application
- Issue has been occurring for several days

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Platform: SleakOps
- Source: GitHub repository
- Deployment type: Automatic deployments
- Duration: Multiple days of failure

**Error Conditions:**

- Deployments fail consistently over multiple days
- Error occurs after code push to GitHub
- Automatic deployment pipeline is not executing
- Manual intervention may be required

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="initial-diagnosis" summary="Check GitHub webhook configuration">

The most common cause of automatic deployment failures is webhook configuration issues:

1. **Verify webhook status in GitHub:**

   - Go to your repository → Settings → Webhooks
   - Check if the SleakOps webhook is active
   - Look for recent delivery failures

2. **Check webhook URL:**

   - Ensure the webhook URL points to the correct SleakOps endpoint
   - Verify the URL format: `https://api.sleakops.com/webhooks/github/{project-id}`

3. **Validate webhook secret:**
   - Confirm the webhook secret matches your SleakOps project configuration
   - If unsure, regenerate the webhook in SleakOps settings

<TroubleshootingItem id="permissions-check" summary="Verify GitHub permissions and tokens">

Check if GitHub access tokens or permissions have expired:

1. **GitHub App permissions:**

   - Go to SleakOps → Project Settings → GitHub Integration
   - Verify the GitHub App is still connected
   - Check if permissions include repository access

2. **Personal Access Token (if used):**

   - Verify the token hasn't expired
   - Ensure token has necessary scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
   - Regenerate token if needed

3. **Repository access:**
   - Confirm SleakOps still has access to the repository
   - Check if repository was moved or renamed

<TroubleshootingItem id="deployment-logs" summary="Review deployment logs and pipeline status">

Examine the deployment logs for specific error messages:

1. **Access deployment logs:**

   - Go to SleakOps Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
   - Click on the failed deployment attempts
   - Review error messages and stack traces

2. **Common error patterns:**

   - `Authentication failed`: Token or webhook issues
   - `Repository not found`: Access or naming issues
   - `Build failed`: Code compilation or dependency issues
   - `Timeout`: Resource or network connectivity issues

3. **Pipeline configuration:**
   - Verify the deployment pipeline configuration is correct
   - Check if any recent changes were made to deployment settings

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="manual-trigger" summary="Test with manual deployment">

Try triggering a manual deployment to isolate the issue:

1. **Manual deployment test:**

   - Go to SleakOps → Your Project → Deployments
   - Click "Deploy Now" or "Manual Deploy"
   - Select the branch you want to deploy

2. **If manual deployment works:**

   - The issue is specifically with automatic triggers
   - Focus on webhook and GitHub integration troubleshooting

3. **If manual deployment fails:**
   - The issue is with the deployment process itself
   - Check build configuration, dependencies, and resource allocation

<TroubleshootingItem id="github-integration-reset" summary="Reset GitHub integration">

If other solutions don't work, try resetting the GitHub integration:

1. **Disconnect and reconnect:**

   - Go to SleakOps → Project Settings → Integrations
   - Disconnect GitHub integration
   - Reconnect and reauthorize access

2. **Reconfigure webhook:**

   - Delete existing webhook from GitHub repository
   - Let SleakOps recreate the webhook automatically
   - Test with a new commit

3. **Verify configuration:**
   - Ensure branch settings are correct
   - Confirm deployment triggers are enabled
   - Check if any deployment rules or conditions are blocking execution

<TroubleshootingItem id="contact-support" summary="When to contact support">

Contact SleakOps support if:

- All troubleshooting steps have been attempted
- Manual deployments also fail
- Error messages are unclear or system-related
- The issue affects multiple projects

**Information to provide:**

- Project name and ID
- GitHub repository URL
- Screenshots of error messages
- Timeline of when the issue started
- Recent changes made to the project or repository
