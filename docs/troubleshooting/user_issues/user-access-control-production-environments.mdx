# User Access Control in Production Environments

**Date:** February 17, 2024  
**Category:** User  
**Tags:** Access Control, IAM, Permissions, Production, Security

## Problem Description

**Context:** Organizations need to implement granular access control when using a single cluster for multiple environments (development, staging, production) while restricting production access to specific team members.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Need to limit production environment access to only 2 team members
- Developers require access to development and staging resources only
- Uncertainty about what resources different user roles can access
- Questions about S3 bucket and database manipulation permissions

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Single cluster hosting multiple environments
- Production, development, and staging environments in same AWS account
- Need for role-based access control (Viewer, Editor, Admin)
- AWS IAM integration with SleakOps

**Error Conditions:**

- Risk of unauthorized access to production resources
- Potential data manipulation by users with excessive permissions
- Lack of proper environment segregation

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="viewer-role-permissions" summary="Understanding Viewer Role Permissions">

The **Viewer** role in SleakOps has three main access requirements:

1. **AWS Account Access**: Users get the [ReadOnlyAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/ReadOnlyAccess.html) AWS managed policy
2. **VPN Access**: Required to access internal resources
3. **SleakOps Platform Access**: Access to the SleakOps interface

**What Viewer role CAN do:**

- View VariableGroups in SleakOps
- Access RDS and other dependencies through VPN
- View cluster resources and configurations
- Access database connection details from VariableGroups or cluster secrets

**What Viewer role CANNOT do:**

- Edit objects in S3 through AWS console (requires Editor role)
- Modify VariableGroups (requires Editor role)
- Make changes to cluster configurations

<TroubleshootingItem id="access-strategies" summary="Recommended Access Control Strategies">

### Strategy 1: VPN-Only Access

For developers who only need database access:

```yaml
Access Level: VPN Only
Permissions:
  - Connect to development/staging databases
  - No AWS console access
  - No SleakOps platform access
Implementation: Share database credentials directly
```

### Strategy 2: Custom IAM Role

Create a custom "Developer" role in production account:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
```
