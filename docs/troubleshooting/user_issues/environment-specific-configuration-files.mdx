# Environment-Specific Configuration Files

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Configuration, Environment, Files, Deployment

## Problem Description

**Context:** User needs to deploy configuration files that vary between different environments (production, development, QA) in SleakOps platform.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Need to upload different configuration files per environment
- Environment variables are available but insufficient for file-based configuration
- Uncertainty about how to handle file variations across environments
- Configuration files contain environment-specific settings

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Multiple environments: prod, dev, qa
- Configuration stored in files (not just environment variables)
- Environment variables are already available
- File content changes based on deployment target

**Error Conditions:**

- Unable to deploy different configuration files per environment
- Configuration files contain hardcoded values for specific environments
- Need dynamic file content based on deployment context

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="configmap-approach" summary="Using ConfigMaps for Environment-Specific Files">

The recommended approach is to use Kubernetes ConfigMaps with environment-specific configurations:

1. **Create separate ConfigMaps** for each environment
2. **Use environment variables** to reference the correct ConfigMap
3. **Mount ConfigMaps as files** in your containers

```yaml
# config-dev.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config-dev
data:
  config.json: |
    {
      "database_url": "dev-db.example.com"
```
