# Deployment Failure Due to Redis Communication Error

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Deployment  
**Tags:** Deployment, Redis, Communication, Troubleshooting, Push

## Problem Description

**Context:** User experiences deployment failures when pushing code to repository. The automatic deployment process gets stuck and doesn't complete successfully.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Deployment process gets stuck after git push
- Automatic deployment doesn't trigger properly
- Deploy action remains in pending state
- No error messages visible to the user initially

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Project: simplee-web-dev
- Environment: dev
- Deployment method: Automatic deployment via git push
- Platform: SleakOps

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs during automatic deployment process
- Triggered by git push to repository
- Deployment pipeline fails to complete
- Issue persists across multiple push attempts

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="root-cause" summary="Understanding the root cause">

This issue is typically caused by Redis communication errors within the SleakOps infrastructure. Redis is used for:

- Managing deployment queues
- Storing deployment state information
- Coordinating between different services
- Caching deployment configurations

When Redis communication fails, deployments get stuck in the queue and cannot proceed.

If you encounter this issue:

1. **Contact SleakOps Support**: This is typically an infrastructure issue that requires admin intervention
2. **Wait for confirmation**: Support team will resolve the Redis communication issue
3. **Retry deployment**: Once confirmed fixed, retry your deployment
4. **Clean conflicting deployments**: Support may need to clean up stuck deployments

**Example support interaction:**

```
Subject: Deployment stuck - Redis communication error
Project: [your-project-name]
Environment: [environment-name]
Issue: Deployment gets stuck after git push
```

Once the Redis issue is resolved:

1. **Verify the fix**: Confirm with support that the issue is resolved
2. **Clean local cache**:
   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   git status
   ```
3. **Trigger new deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change or use empty commit
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Retry deployment after Redis fix"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **Monitor deployment**: Watch the deployment progress in SleakOps dashboard

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention" summary="Prevention and monitoring">

To minimize impact of similar issues:

1. **Monitor deployment status**: Always check deployment completion in SleakOps dashboard
2. **Set up notifications**: Configure deployment status notifications
3. **Have rollback plan**: Keep previous working version ready
4. **Regular health checks**: Monitor your application health after deployments

**Deployment monitoring checklist:**

- [ ] Deployment started successfully
- [ ] Build process completed
- [ ] Container deployment successful
- [ ] Application health check passed
- [ ] Traffic routing updated

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting" summary="Additional troubleshooting steps">

If the problem persists after Redis fix:

1. **Check deployment logs**:

   - Go to SleakOps dashboard
   - Navigate to your project
   - Check deployment history and logs

2. **Verify repository configuration**:

   ```yaml
   # Check .sleakops/config.yml
   version: "1"
   environments:
     dev:
       cluster: your-cluster
       namespace: your-namespace
   ```

3. **Test with minimal change**:

   ```bash
   # Update timestamp or version
   echo "# Updated $(date)" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Test deployment"
   git push
   ```

4. **Contact support with details**:
   - Project name and environment
   - Exact time of deployment attempt
   - Any error messages from logs
   - Git commit hash that failed
