# Production Site Down - Emergency Troubleshooting

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Category:** General  
**Tags:** Production, Outage, Deployment, Emergency, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Production site experiencing downtime requiring immediate attention and emergency deployment procedures through SleakOps platform.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Complete site outage ("Se nos cayó el sitio")
- Site under construction status
- Urgent production environment issues
- Need for emergency deployment coordination
- Multiple team members required for resolution

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Environment: Production
- Platform: SleakOps with Bitbucket integration
- Deployment method: Bitbucket pipelines
- Team coordination: Required for production changes

**Error Conditions:**

- Production site completely down
- Emergency deployment needed
- Multiple stakeholders involved in resolution
- Time-sensitive restoration required

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-assessment" summary="Immediate Site Assessment">

When facing a production outage:

1. **Verify the scope of the outage**:

   - Check if it's a complete site failure or partial functionality
   - Verify DNS resolution and basic connectivity
   - Check monitoring dashboards for alerts

2. **Gather initial information**:

   - Recent deployments or changes
   - Error logs from applications
   - Infrastructure status (pods, services, ingress)

3. **Establish communication**:
   - Create emergency communication channel
   - Notify all relevant stakeholders
   - Document timeline of events

<TroubleshootingItem id="emergency-deployment" summary="Emergency Deployment Procedures">

For emergency deployments in SleakOps:

1. **Coordinate with team**:

   ```bash
   # Before any production deployment, ensure team coordination
   # Use communication channels to announce deployment
   ```

2. **Deploy through SleakOps**:

   - Access SleakOps dashboard
   - Navigate to the affected project
   - Select the production environment
   - Choose "Deploy" with the last known good version

3. **Alternative deployment via Bitbucket**:

   ```yaml
   # If deploying through Bitbucket pipelines
   # Ensure the pipeline targets the correct environment
   pipelines:
     branches:
       main:
         - step:
             name: Emergency Deploy to Production
             script:
               - echo "Emergency deployment initiated"
               -  # Your deployment commands here
   ```

4. **Monitor deployment progress**:
   - Watch deployment logs in real-time
   - Monitor application health checks
   - Verify service restoration

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="rollback-procedures" summary="Rollback Procedures">

If the emergency deployment doesn't resolve the issue:

1. **Immediate rollback**:

   - In SleakOps: Use "Rollback" feature to previous stable version
   - Document the rollback decision and timing

2. **Verify rollback success**:

   ```bash
   # Check application status
   kubectl get pods -n production
   kubectl get services -n production

   # Verify application health
   curl -I https://your-production-site.com
   ```

3. **Post-rollback actions**:
   - Confirm site functionality
   - Notify stakeholders of temporary resolution
   - Begin root cause analysis

<TroubleshootingItem id="team-coordination" summary="Team Coordination During Outages">

Effective coordination during production incidents:

1. **Establish incident commander**:

   - Designate one person to coordinate efforts
   - All deployment decisions go through this person
   - Maintain clear communication channels

2. **Role assignments**:

   - **Incident Commander**: Overall coordination
   - **Technical Lead**: Hands-on troubleshooting
   - **Communications**: Stakeholder updates
   - **Documentation**: Timeline and actions taken

3. **Communication protocols**:

   - Use video calls for real-time coordination
   - Maintain written updates in shared channels
   - Set regular update intervals (every 15-30 minutes)

4. **Decision making**:
   - Quick consensus on deployment actions
   - Clear go/no-go decisions
   - Document all major decisions with timestamps

<TroubleshootingItem id="post-incident" summary="Post-Incident Actions">

After resolving the production outage:

1. **Immediate verification**:

   - Comprehensive functionality testing
   - Performance monitoring for 1-2 hours
   - User acceptance verification

2. **Documentation**:

   - Complete incident timeline
   - Root cause analysis
   - Actions taken and their outcomes
   - Lessons learned

3. **Follow-up improvements**:

   - Review deployment procedures
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting
   - Update emergency response procedures
   - Schedule post-mortem meeting

4. **Stakeholder communication**:
   - Send resolution notification
   - Provide brief summary of cause and fix
   - Share timeline for detailed post-mortem

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention-measures" summary="Prevention and Preparedness">

To minimize future production outages:

1. **Deployment best practices**:

   - Always use staging environment first
   - Implement blue-green deployments
   - Maintain rollback procedures
   - Use feature flags for risky changes

2. **Monitoring and alerting**:

   ```yaml
   # Example monitoring configuration
   alerts:
     - name: site-down
       condition: http_status != 200
       duration: 1m
       severity: critical
       notifications:
         - slack
         - email
   ```

3. **Emergency preparedness**:

   - Maintain updated emergency contact list
   - Regular disaster recovery drills
   - Pre-defined communication channels
   - Emergency deployment procedures documentation

4. **Team readiness**:
   - Cross-training on deployment procedures
   - Access permissions for key team members
   - Emergency escalation procedures
   - Regular review of incident response plans
