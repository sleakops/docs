# Domain Setup Alert Explanation

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Domain, Alert, Setup, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users receive "Setup domain" alerts for domains that appear to be functioning correctly, causing confusion about whether action is required.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Multiple domains showing "Setup domain" alert
- Domains are accessible and functioning normally (e.g., https://www.mocona.com.ar/)
- Alert appears despite proper domain functionality
- Uncertainty about required actions

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Domain status: Functional and accessible
- Alert type: "Setup domain"
- Domain examples: External domains like mocona.com.ar
- Platform: SleakOps domain management

**Error Conditions:**

- Alert appears for working domains
- No apparent functional issues with the domains
- Alert persists despite normal operation

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="alert-meaning" summary="What does 'Setup domain' alert mean?">

The "Setup domain" alert in SleakOps indicates one of the following conditions:

1. **DNS Configuration Incomplete**: The domain's DNS records are not properly configured to point to your SleakOps services
2. **SSL Certificate Pending**: The SSL certificate for the domain is still being provisioned or validated
3. **Domain Verification Pending**: The platform is waiting for domain ownership verification
4. **Configuration Mismatch**: There's a discrepancy between the expected and actual domain configuration

This alert can appear even when the domain is accessible because it may be pointing to a different server or service.

<TroubleshootingItem id="when-action-needed" summary="When do you need to take action?">

You should take action if:

- **Your application is not accessible** through the domain
- **SSL certificate errors** appear when accessing the domain
- **You want the domain to point to your SleakOps deployment** instead of its current destination
- **Email notifications** indicate failed deployments or services

You can **ignore the alert** if:

- The domain is working as expected
- It's pointing to the correct destination (even if not SleakOps)
- You're using the domain for external services

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="verification-steps" summary="How to verify if action is needed">

To determine if you need to take action:

1. **Check where your domain points**:

   ```bash
   nslookup www.mocona.com.ar
   # or
   dig www.mocona.com.ar
   ```

2. **Verify SSL certificate**:

   - Visit your domain in a browser
   - Check if there are SSL warnings
   - Verify the certificate issuer

3. **Check SleakOps deployment status**:

   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Verify if services are running
   - Check deployment logs for errors

4. **Test application functionality**:
   - Access all critical pages
   - Test forms and interactive elements
   - Verify API endpoints if applicable

<TroubleshootingItem id="resolving-alert" summary="How to resolve the alert (if needed)">

If you determine action is needed:

**For DNS Configuration:**

1. Go to your domain registrar's DNS management
2. Update A records to point to SleakOps IP addresses
3. Update CNAME records as specified in your SleakOps project

**For SSL Certificate Issues:**

1. In SleakOps dashboard, go to **Domain Settings**
2. Click **Regenerate SSL Certificate**
3. Wait for validation (can take up to 24 hours)

**For Domain Verification:**

1. Check your email for verification requests
2. Follow the verification link or add required DNS TXT records
3. Contact support if verification fails

**Configuration Example:**

```dns
# DNS Records for SleakOps
www.yourdomain.com    A      1.2.3.4
yourdomain.com        A      1.2.3.4
*.yourdomain.com      CNAME  your-project.sleakops.com
```

If the domain is working correctly and you don't want it managed by SleakOps:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Domains**
2. Find the domain with the alert
3. Click **Remove Domain** or **Disable Monitoring**
4. Confirm the action

Alternatively, you can:

- **Mute notifications** for specific domains
- **Configure alert thresholds** to reduce false positives
- **Contact support** to whitelist external domains
