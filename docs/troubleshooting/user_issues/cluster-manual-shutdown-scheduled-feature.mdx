# Cluster Manual Shutdown Requires Scheduled Feature

**Date:** December 12, 2024  
**Category:** Cluster  
**Tags:** Cluster, Shutdown, Scheduled, Manual, Configuration

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users want to manually stop their SleakOps cluster at specific times (for testing, cost optimization, etc.) but find that the manual shutdown button is not available or functional.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Manual cluster shutdown button is not available in the interface
- Cannot stop cluster manually even when needed for specific situations
- Cluster remains active consuming resources when not needed
- No option to pause cluster for undefined periods

**Relevant Configuration:**

- SleakOps cluster deployed and running
- Scheduled Shutdown feature: Not enabled
- Manual shutdown requirement: Immediate or flexible timing
- Use case: Testing, development, cost optimization

**Error Conditions:**

- Manual shutdown not possible without scheduled feature enabled
- Resources continue consuming costs during inactive periods
- Cannot pause cluster for undefined time periods
- Inflexibility for ad-hoc cluster management needs

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="enable-scheduled-feature" summary="Enable Scheduled Shutdown Feature">

To enable manual cluster shutdown, you must first activate the "Scheduled Shutdown" feature:

1. Go to your **Cluster Configuration**
2. Look for the **"Scheduled Shutdown"** option
3. **Enable** this feature
4. Configure basic schedule settings (can be minimal)

Once enabled, this feature runs a background module that allows both scheduled and manual shutdown operations.

<TroubleshootingItem id="configure-minimal-schedule" summary="Configure Minimal Schedule for Manual Control">

You can set up a minimal schedule that gives you maximum manual control:

```yaml
# Example minimal configuration
scheduled_shutdown:
  enabled: true
  schedule:
    # Set a very permissive schedule or off-hours only
    weekdays: []
    weekend: []
    timezone: "UTC"
```

**Steps:**

1. Enable Scheduled Shutdown
2. Set minimal or no automatic schedules
3. Use manual controls as needed
4. The feature can be disabled later if not needed

After enabling the Scheduled Shutdown feature:

1. Navigate to your cluster dashboard
2. Look for the **shutdown/stop button** (now available)
3. Click to manually stop the cluster
4. Start the cluster manually when needed
5. No predefined schedule required for manual operations

**Benefits:**

- Stop cluster during testing breaks
- Pause for undefined periods
- Resume when needed
- Optimize costs for development environments

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="development-cluster-example" summary="Development Cluster Configuration Example">

For development clusters that need flexible on/off control:

```yaml
cluster_config:
  name: "dev-cluster"
  scheduled_shutdown:
    enabled: true
    auto_schedule: false # No automatic scheduling
    manual_control: true # Enable manual start/stop

# This allows:
# - Manual shutdown anytime
# - Manual startup when needed
# - No automatic operations
# - Cost optimization for dev environments
```

**Use Cases:**

- Development and testing environments
- Clusters used sporadically
- Cost-sensitive projects
- Temporary project pauses

<TroubleshootingItem id="platform-limitation" summary="Current Platform Limitation">

**Known Issue:** This requirement is currently a platform inconsistency that should be improved.

**Current Behavior:**

- Manual shutdown requires Scheduled Shutdown feature enabled
- Background module must be running for shutdown capabilities
- SleakOps runs various resources continuously by default

**Expected Future Improvement:**

- Manual shutdown should be available without scheduling requirements
- More flexible cluster management options
- Better separation between scheduled and manual operations

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="workaround-strategies" summary="Workaround Strategies">

Until the platform limitation is resolved:

1. **Enable Scheduled Shutdown** even if you don't need automatic scheduling
2. **Set minimal schedules** that don't interfere with your workflow
3. **Use manual controls** as your primary shutdown method
4. **Document your usage patterns** to optimize future configurations

**Cost Optimization Tips:**

- Enable the feature immediately after cluster creation
- Stop clusters during known inactive periods
- Monitor resource usage to identify optimization opportunities
- Consider multiple smaller clusters instead of one large always-on cluster
