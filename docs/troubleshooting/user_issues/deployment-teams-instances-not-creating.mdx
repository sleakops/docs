# Deployment and Teams Instances Not Creating

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Deployment, Teams, Instances, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** User reports that deployments are not executing and Teams instances are not being created in the SleakOps platform.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Deployments are not being triggered or completed
- Teams instances are not being created
- No visible progress in deployment pipeline
- Services may appear stuck in pending state

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Domain: teams.simplee.cl
- Platform: SleakOps
- Deployment type: Teams instances

**Error Conditions:**

- Deployment process fails to start or complete
- Instance creation process does not execute
- May affect multiple services or environments

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="initial-diagnosis" summary="Check deployment status and logs">

First, verify the current status of your deployments:

1. **Navigate to your Project Dashboard**
2. **Check the Deployments section** for any failed or pending deployments
3. **Review deployment logs** for error messages
4. **Verify the build status** in the CI/CD pipeline

Look for common indicators:

- Red status indicators
- Error messages in logs
- Stuck "pending" states
- Resource allocation issues

<TroubleshootingItem id="teams-configuration" summary="Verify Teams instance configuration">

Check your Teams instance configuration:

1. **Go to Workloads** → **Teams Services**
2. **Verify the configuration** for teams.simplee.cl
3. **Check resource allocation**:
   - CPU and memory limits
   - Storage requirements
   - Network configuration

```yaml
# Example Teams configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: teams-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: teams
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="resource-verification" summary="Check cluster resources and quotas">

Verify that your cluster has sufficient resources:

1. **Check Node Resources**:

   - Available CPU and memory
   - Disk space
   - Network capacity

2. **Verify Quotas**:

   - Namespace resource quotas
   - Cluster-wide limits
   - Provider-specific quotas (AWS, Azure, GCP)

3. **Review Pod Status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n your-namespace
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n your-namespace
   ```

<TroubleshootingItem id="networking-dns" summary="Verify networking and DNS configuration">

For Teams instances, networking configuration is critical:

1. **Check DNS Configuration**:

   - Verify teams.simplee.cl DNS records
   - Ensure proper A/CNAME records point to load balancer

2. **Verify Load Balancer**:

   - Check if load balancer is provisioned
   - Verify security groups and firewall rules

3. **Test Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   nslookup teams.simplee.cl
   curl -I https://teams.simplee.cl
   ```

<TroubleshootingItem id="common-solutions" summary="Common solutions for deployment issues">

**Restart Deployment Process**:

1. Navigate to your project
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click **Redeploy** on the failed deployment

**Clear Stuck Resources**:

1. Delete stuck pods manually if needed
2. Restart deployment controllers
3. Check for resource locks or conflicts

**Update Configuration**:

1. Verify all environment variables
2. Check secrets and configmaps
3. Ensure image repositories are accessible

**Scale Resources**:

1. Increase node capacity if needed
2. Adjust resource requests and limits
3. Consider using different instance types

<TroubleshootingItem id="escalation-steps" summary="When to escalate the issue">

Escalate to SleakOps support if:

1. **Infrastructure Issues**:

   - Cluster nodes are not responding
   - Provider-level service outages
   - Persistent resource allocation failures

2. **Platform Issues**:

   - SleakOps dashboard not responding
   - Deployment pipeline completely broken
   - Authentication or authorization failures

3. **Data Loss Concerns**:
   - Persistent volumes not mounting
   - Database connectivity issues
   - Backup and recovery problems

**Information to provide when escalating**:

- Project name and environment
- Specific error messages from logs
- Timeline of when the issue started
- Recent changes made to configuration
- Screenshots of error states
