# Deployment Stuck in Creating Status

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Deployment, Build, Troubleshooting, Stuck, Creating

## Problem Description

**Context:** User pushes code to a branch and triggers a deployment through SleakOps. The build process completes successfully, but the deployment phase gets stuck in "creating" status for extended periods.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Build process completes successfully
- Deployment remains in "creating" status for more than 14 minutes
- No visible progress or error messages during deployment phase
- Application may or may not actually deploy despite stuck status
- Issue occurs intermittently on specific branches

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Deployment type: `deploy_build_dev`
- Platform: SleakOps
- Build status: Successful
- Deployment status: Stuck in "creating"

**Error Conditions:**

- Occurs after successful build completion
- Deployment phase hangs without timeout
- No clear error messages in the UI
- May require manual intervention to resolve

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-troubleshooting" summary="Immediate troubleshooting steps">

When a deployment gets stuck in "creating" status:

1. **Check deployment logs**: Look for any error messages in the deployment logs
2. **Verify cluster status**: Ensure the target cluster is healthy and responsive
3. **Check pod status**: Verify if pods are actually being created despite the UI showing "creating"
4. **Monitor resource usage**: Check if there are resource constraints (CPU, memory, storage)

```bash
# Check pod status in the cluster
kubectl get pods -n your-namespace

# Check deployment status
kubectl get deployments -n your-namespace

# Check events for any issues
kubectl get events -n your-namespace --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="common-causes" summary="Common causes and solutions">

**Resource Constraints:**

- Insufficient CPU or memory in the cluster
- Storage quota exceeded
- Node capacity issues

**Solution:** Scale up cluster resources or optimize application resource requests

**Image Pull Issues:**

- Container image not found or inaccessible
- Registry authentication problems
- Network connectivity issues

**Solution:** Verify image exists and registry credentials are valid

**Configuration Problems:**

- Invalid environment variables
- Missing secrets or config maps
- Incorrect service configurations

**Solution:** Review and validate all configuration files

<TroubleshootingItem id="platform-intervention" summary="When to contact SleakOps support">

Contact SleakOps support if:

1. **Deployment stuck for more than 15 minutes** without any progress
2. **Cluster appears healthy** but deployments consistently fail
3. **No clear error messages** in logs or UI
4. **Multiple deployments affected** across different projects

When contacting support, provide:

- Project name and branch
- Deployment timestamp
- Any error messages or logs
- Recent infrastructure or application changes

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention-measures" summary="Prevention and best practices">

**Resource Management:**

```yaml
# Set appropriate resource limits
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "200m"
```

**Health Checks:**

```yaml
# Configure proper health checks
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

**Deployment Strategy:**

```yaml
# Use rolling updates for safer deployments
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 1
    maxSurge: 1
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="manual-recovery" summary="Manual recovery steps">

If deployment remains stuck:

1. **Cancel current deployment** (if option available in UI)
2. **Wait for platform team intervention** to unlock stuck deployments
3. **Retry deployment** after confirmation from support
4. **Monitor closely** for similar issues in subsequent deployments

**Post-resolution actions:**

- Verify application is running correctly
- Check all services are accessible
- Monitor application logs for any issues
- Document any configuration changes made
