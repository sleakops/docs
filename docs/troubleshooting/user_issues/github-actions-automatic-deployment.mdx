To generate the GitHub Actions workflow file:

1. **Access SleakOps Console**

   - Log into your SleakOps dashboard
   - Navigate to your project

2. **Generate CI/CD Configuration**

   - Look for the CI/CD or GitHub Actions section
   - The console will provide a pre-configured workflow file
   - This file includes all necessary steps for deployment

3. **Download Configuration**
   - Copy the generated workflow file
   - Note the required secret keys that will be displayed

Once you have the workflow file from SleakOps console:

1. **Create Workflow Directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Add Workflow File**

   - Create a new file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Paste the configuration provided by SleakOps console

3. **Basic Workflow Structure**

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to SleakOps

   on:
     push:
       branches: [main, master]

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Deploy to SleakOps
           run: |
             # SleakOps CLI commands will be here
           env:
             SLEAKOPS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLEAKOPS_TOKEN }}
             SLEAKOPS_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.SLEAKOPS_PROJECT_ID }}
   ```

To verify your setup works correctly:

1. **Make a Test Commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test automatic deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor GitHub Actions**

   - Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
   - Watch the workflow execution
   - Check for any errors in the logs

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check SleakOps console for deployment status
   - Verify your application is updated
   - Test the deployed application

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting" summary="Common troubleshooting steps">

If the deployment fails:

1. **Check Secrets**

   - Verify all required secrets are configured
   - Ensure secret names match exactly
   - Check that tokens haven't expired

2. **Review Workflow Logs**

   - Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
   - Look for authentication or permission issues
   - Verify CLI commands are executing correctly

3. **Validate SleakOps Configuration**

   - Ensure your SleakOps project is properly configured
   - Check that the CLI has necessary permissions
   - Verify project ID is correct

4. **Test CLI Locally**
   ```bash
   # Install SleakOps CLI locally to test
   npm install -g @sleakops/cli
   sleakops deploy --help
   ```
