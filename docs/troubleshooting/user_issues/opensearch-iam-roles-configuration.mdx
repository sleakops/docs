## Problem Description

**Context:** User is setting up an OpenSearch service in SleakOps and has questions about whether IAM roles are required for proper access configuration.

**Observed Symptoms:**

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="iam-requirements" summary="Do I need IAM roles for OpenSearch?">

Yes, OpenSearch in AWS typically requires IAM roles for secure access. The specific requirements depend on your access method:

**For VPC-based access (recommended):**

- IAM roles are required for applications to access the OpenSearch cluster
- Fine-grained access control can be configured

**For public access:**

- IAM policies can be used alongside IP-based restrictions
- Less secure but simpler for development environments

<TroubleshootingItem id="automatic-configuration" summary="How SleakOps handles IAM for OpenSearch">

SleakOps automatically configures basic IAM roles for OpenSearch:

1. **Service Role**: Created automatically for the OpenSearch service itself
2. **Access Role**: Generated for applications within your cluster to access OpenSearch
3. **Master User**: Configured with administrative permissions

**What's configured automatically:**

```json

  "Version": "2012-10-17"
```
