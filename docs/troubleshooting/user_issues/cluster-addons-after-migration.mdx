# Cluster Addons Missing After Migration

**Date:** October 15, 2024  
**Category:** Cluster  
**Tags:** Migration, Addons, Loki, Grafana, Monitoring

## Problem Description

**Context:** After a cluster migration in SleakOps, users cannot locate previously installed addons such as Loki, Grafana, and other monitoring tools in the new interface.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Cluster addons (Loki, Grafana, etc.) are not visible in the new interface
- Previously configured monitoring tools appear to be missing
- Users cannot access monitoring dashboards that were available before migration
- Uncertainty about addon status after platform migration

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Platform: SleakOps with new interface
- Affected addons: Loki, Grafana, and other monitoring tools
- Migration context: Recent cluster migration performed
- Interface: Updated/new SleakOps interface

**Error Conditions:**

- Addons not visible immediately after migration
- Occurs when accessing the new interface post-migration
- Affects monitoring and logging capabilities
- May impact operational visibility

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="addon-deactivation-explanation" summary="Why addons are temporarily unavailable">

During cluster migrations, SleakOps temporarily deactivates addons to ensure:

1. **Data integrity**: Prevents data corruption during the migration process
2. **Resource management**: Avoids conflicts between old and new cluster configurations
3. **Clean migration**: Ensures addons are properly reconfigured for the new environment
4. **State consistency**: Maintains consistent addon states across the migration

This is a standard procedure and addons are reactivated once the migration is complete.

<TroubleshootingItem id="locating-addons-new-interface" summary="How to locate addons in the new interface">

To find your addons in the updated SleakOps interface:

1. **Navigate to Cluster Management**:

   - Go to your cluster dashboard
   - Look for the "Addons" or "Extensions" section

2. **Check the Monitoring Section**:

   - Access the "Monitoring" tab
   - Look for Grafana, Loki, and other monitoring tools

3. **Verify Addon Status**:

   - Check if addons show as "Active" or "Pending"
   - Some addons may need a few minutes to fully initialize

4. **Access Grafana Dashboard**:
   ```
   # Typical Grafana access pattern
   https://grafana.[your-cluster-domain]
   ```

If addons are still not visible:

1. **Wait for automatic reactivation**:

   - Most addons reactivate automatically within 10-15 minutes
   - Check the cluster status for any pending operations

2. **Manual reactivation if needed**:

   - Go to Cluster Settings → Addons
   - Toggle off and on any addons that appear inactive
   - Save the configuration

3. **Verify addon health**:

   ```bash
   # Check addon pods status
   kubectl get pods -n monitoring
   kubectl get pods -n logging
   ```

4. **Contact support if issues persist**:
   - If addons don't appear after 30 minutes
   - If you encounter errors during reactivation

<TroubleshootingItem id="post-migration-verification" summary="Verifying addon functionality">

After addons are visible, verify they're working correctly:

1. **Grafana Dashboard Access**:

   - Log into Grafana using your SleakOps credentials
   - Verify dashboards are displaying data
   - Check that data sources are connected

2. **Loki Log Aggregation**:

   - Verify logs are being collected
   - Check log retention policies
   - Test log queries in Grafana

3. **Monitoring Alerts**:

   - Verify alert rules are active
   - Test notification channels
   - Check alert history

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Confirm metrics collection is working
   - Verify historical data availability
   - Check metric retention settings

If addons remain unavailable:

1. **Check cluster resources**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   kubectl top nodes
   ```

2. **Verify namespace status**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get namespaces
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

3. **Review addon logs**:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n monitoring deployment/grafana
   kubectl logs -n logging deployment/loki
   ```

4. **Common solutions**:
   - Restart addon deployments
   - Check for resource constraints
   - Verify network policies
   - Review storage class availability
