# Project Stuck in Analyzing State - Missing Dockerfile

**Date:** December 11, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Dockerfile, Analyzing, Deployment, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** A new project in SleakOps gets stuck permanently in the "analyzing" state and cannot proceed with the deployment process.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Project remains in "analyzing" state indefinitely
- No progress in the deployment pipeline
- Build process does not advance to next stages
- No clear error messages displayed in the UI

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Project type: New project
- Status: Stuck in analyzing phase
- Repository: Connected to source code repository
- Dockerfile: Missing or not detected

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs during initial project analysis
- Happens when SleakOps cannot find a Dockerfile in the repository
- Problem persists until Dockerfile is properly configured
- May occur if Dockerfile was added after the initial analysis

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="dockerfile-verification" summary="Verify Dockerfile presence and location">

First, check if your repository contains a Dockerfile:

1. **Check repository root**: Ensure there's a file named `Dockerfile` (case-sensitive) in the root directory
2. **Verify file contents**: The Dockerfile should contain valid Docker instructions
3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the file is readable and properly committed to the repository

```bash
# Example of a basic Dockerfile structure
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="dockerfile-creation" summary="Create a Dockerfile if missing">

If your repository doesn't have a Dockerfile, you need to create one:

1. **Create the file**: Add a file named `Dockerfile` in your repository root
2. **Choose appropriate base image**: Select based on your application technology
3. **Define build steps**: Include all necessary commands to build your application
4. **Commit and push**: Make sure to commit the Dockerfile to your repository

**Common Dockerfile templates:**

```dockerfile
# Node.js application
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

```dockerfile
# Python application
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

After adding or fixing the Dockerfile:

1. **Commit changes**: Ensure the Dockerfile is committed to your repository
2. **Trigger reanalysis**: In SleakOps dashboard:
   - Go to your project
   - Look for "Re-analyze" or "Refresh" button
   - Click to trigger a new analysis
3. **Monitor progress**: Watch the project status change from "analyzing" to the next phase

<TroubleshootingItem id="dockerfile-validation" summary="Validate Dockerfile syntax">

Before committing, validate your Dockerfile:

```bash
# Test Dockerfile locally
docker build -t test-image .

# Check for syntax errors
docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile
```

**Common Dockerfile issues:**

- Missing `FROM` instruction
- Incorrect file paths in `COPY` commands
- Missing executable permissions
- Wrong working directory setup

<TroubleshootingItem id="alternative-solutions" summary="Alternative solutions if problem persists">

If the project remains stuck after adding a Dockerfile:

1. **Check repository permissions**: Ensure SleakOps has access to read the repository
2. **Verify branch**: Make sure you're working on the correct branch
3. **Clear cache**: Try disconnecting and reconnecting the repository
4. **Contact support**: If the issue persists, provide:
   - Repository URL
   - Dockerfile contents
   - Project configuration details
