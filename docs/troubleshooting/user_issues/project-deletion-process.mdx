# How to Delete a Project in SleakOps

**Date:** March 13, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Project, Deletion, Management, Cleanup

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to understand how to properly delete projects in SleakOps and what components are affected when a project is deleted.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Unable to find project deletion option in the interface
- Uncertainty about what gets deleted along with the project
- Need to clean up projects with naming issues or technical debt
- Questions about the impact on associated resources

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Project contains: Docker args, workloads, dependencies, vargroups
- Associated resources: Environment-specific configurations
- Dependencies: Database connections, external services
- Variable groups: Shared across projects or workload-specific

**Error Conditions:**

- Deletion option not visible in expected locations
- Uncertainty about cascading deletions
- Risk of losing important configuration data

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="preparation-steps" summary="What to document before deleting a project">

Before deleting a project, make sure to document the following components:

**1. Docker Arguments**

- Note all custom docker args configured for the project
- Document any special build configurations

**2. Workloads**

- List all workloads within the project
- Document their configurations and settings

**3. Dependencies**

- Record all project dependencies (databases, caches, etc.)
- Note connection strings and configurations

**4. Variable Groups (VarGroups)**

- Document vargroups associated with the project
- Note vargroups associated with specific workloads
- Check if any vargroups are shared with other projects

<TroubleshootingItem id="what-gets-deleted" summary="What components are deleted with the project">

When you delete a project, the following components are **automatically removed**:

**✅ Deleted with Project:**

- The project itself
- All workloads within the project
- Project-specific dependencies
- Variable groups associated exclusively with the project
- Variable groups associated with workloads in the project
- Project-specific docker configurations
- Environment configurations for this project

**⚠️ Potentially Affected:**

- Shared variable groups (if used by other projects)
- External dependencies (databases, services) - these may need manual cleanup

**❌ Not Deleted:**

- Cluster infrastructure
- Other projects in the same cluster
- Shared resources used by multiple projects

<TroubleshootingItem id="deletion-process" summary="Step-by-step deletion process">

**Step 1: Backup Important Data**

```bash
# Export project configuration (if available via CLI)
sleakops project export --project-name your-project-name
```

**Step 2: Document Dependencies**

- Take screenshots of dependency configurations
- Note down database connection strings
- Document any custom environment variables

**Step 3: Check Shared Resources**

- Verify which vargroups are shared with other projects
- Ensure no other projects depend on this project's resources

**Step 4: Perform Deletion**

1. Go to **Project Settings > General Settings**
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page
3. Click **Delete Project**
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted
5. Wait for the deletion process to complete

**Step 5: Verify Cleanup**

- Check that the project no longer appears in your project list
- Verify that associated workloads are removed
- Confirm that exclusive vargroups are deleted

<TroubleshootingItem id="recreation-best-practices" summary="Best practices when recreating projects">

If you're deleting a project to recreate it (e.g., to fix naming issues):

**Naming Conventions:**

- Avoid redundant suffixes (e.g., don't use both project name and environment in the name)
- Use clear, descriptive names: `admin` instead of `sostengo-admin-prod-prod`
- Remember that environment suffixes are added automatically

**Configuration Management:**

- Use the documented configurations from the deleted project
- Apply lessons learned to avoid technical debt
- Consider using Infrastructure as Code approaches for future projects

**Timing Considerations:**

- Plan the deletion and recreation during maintenance windows
- Ensure all team members are aware of the changes
- Have rollback plans in case of issues

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting" summary="Troubleshooting deletion issues">

**If you can't find the deletion option:**

- Check your user permissions - you may need admin access
- Ensure you're in the correct project context
- Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache

**If deletion fails:**

- Check for active deployments that need to be stopped first
- Verify there are no running workloads
- Contact support if the project appears to be stuck in a deletion state

**After deletion:**

- If resources appear to still exist, wait a few minutes for propagation
- Check the activity logs for deletion status
- Contact support if cleanup appears incomplete
