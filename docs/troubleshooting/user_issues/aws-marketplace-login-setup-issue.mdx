# AWS Marketplace Login and Setup Issue

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** User  
**Tags:** AWS Marketplace, Authentication, Login, Setup

## Problem Description

**Context:** User subscribed to SleakOps through AWS Marketplace but encounters authentication issues when trying to complete the product setup.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- After subscribing through AWS Marketplace, clicking "Setup Product" redirects to registration page
- System doesn't recognize the user as logged in
- Manual login redirects to home page without completing setup
- Issue persists across multiple attempts in the same browser session
- Setup process never completes successfully

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Subscription method: AWS Marketplace
- Browser: Same browser used throughout the process
- Login status: User appears logged in but system doesn't recognize it
- Setup stage: Initial product setup after marketplace subscription

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs immediately after AWS Marketplace subscription
- Happens when clicking "Setup Product" button
- Persists after manual login attempts
- Occurs consistently across multiple browser sessions

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="marketplace-flow-explanation" summary="Understanding AWS Marketplace Integration">

When you subscribe to SleakOps through AWS Marketplace, there's a specific authentication flow that needs to be completed:

1. **AWS Marketplace Subscription**: You subscribe through AWS
2. **Redirect to SleakOps**: AWS redirects you to our platform with special tokens
3. **Account Linking**: Your AWS account gets linked to a SleakOps account
4. **Setup Completion**: The product setup process begins

If this flow is interrupted, authentication issues can occur.

<TroubleshootingItem id="browser-cache-solution" summary="Clear Browser Cache and Cookies">

The most common cause is browser cache conflicts. Follow these steps:

1. **Clear SleakOps cookies**:

   - Go to your browser settings
   - Find "Cookies and site data"
   - Search for `sleakops.com` and delete all cookies

2. **Clear AWS Marketplace cookies**:

   - Also clear cookies for `aws.amazon.com`
   - This ensures a clean authentication state

3. **Clear browser cache**:

   - Clear cached images and files
   - This prevents old authentication tokens from interfering

4. **Restart the process**:
   - Go back to AWS Marketplace
   - Click "Setup Product" again

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="incognito-mode-test" summary="Try Incognito/Private Browsing Mode">

To isolate browser-related issues:

1. **Open incognito/private window**
2. **Go to AWS Marketplace**
3. **Navigate to your SleakOps subscription**
4. **Click "Setup Product"**

If this works, the issue is definitely browser cache/cookies related.

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="manual-account-linking" summary="Manual Account Linking Process">

If the automatic flow fails, you can manually link your accounts:

1. **Create a SleakOps account** (if you don't have one):

   - Go to `https://app.sleakops.com/register`
   - Use the same email address as your AWS account

2. **Contact support** with:

   - Your AWS account ID
   - Your SleakOps account email
   - Your AWS Marketplace subscription details

3. **We'll manually link** your accounts and activate your subscription

<TroubleshootingItem id="alternative-browsers" summary="Try Different Browsers">

Some browsers have stricter security policies that can interfere with cross-domain authentication:

**Recommended browsers:**

- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Safari (if on macOS)

**Browsers to avoid:**

- Older versions of Internet Explorer
- Browsers with aggressive ad blockers
- Browsers with strict privacy settings

**Browser settings to check:**

- Disable ad blockers for AWS and SleakOps domains
- Allow third-party cookies temporarily
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
