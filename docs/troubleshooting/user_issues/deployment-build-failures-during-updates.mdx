# Deployment Build Failures During Platform Updates

**Date:** October 14, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Deployment, Build, Updates, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users experience deployment failures when trying to make their projects public during scheduled platform updates. The build process fails temporarily while the SleakOps platform undergoes maintenance or updates.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Deployment errors when changing project visibility to public
- Build failures during specific time windows
- Error occurs without any downtime to running services
- Temporary inability to deploy new changes

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Project type: Development environment
- Action attempted: Changing project visibility to public
- Platform status: Under scheduled maintenance/update
- Service availability: No downtime for running services

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs during scheduled platform updates
- Build process fails temporarily
- Deployment pipeline is affected
- Running services remain unaffected

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="understanding-build-failures" summary="Understanding build failures during updates">

Build failures during platform updates are temporary issues that occur when:

1. **Platform components are being updated**: Core build infrastructure undergoes maintenance
2. **Build pipelines are temporarily unavailable**: CI/CD systems may be restarting
3. **Resource allocation changes**: Build resources are temporarily redistributed
4. **Configuration updates**: Platform settings are being modified

**Important**: These failures do not affect running applications - only new deployments are impacted.

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-resolution" summary="Immediate resolution steps">

When encountering build failures during updates:

1. **Wait for update completion**: Most platform updates complete within 15-30 minutes
2. **Retry the deployment**: Once updates are complete, retry your original action
3. **Check platform status**: Monitor SleakOps status page or notifications
4. **Verify project state**: Ensure your project configuration remains intact

```bash
# Example: Retry deployment after update
# No special commands needed - simply retry through the UI
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention-strategies" summary="Prevention and best practices">

To minimize impact from scheduled updates:

1. **Schedule deployments appropriately**:

   - Avoid deployments during announced maintenance windows
   - Plan critical deployments outside update schedules

2. **Monitor platform communications**:

   - Subscribe to SleakOps status updates
   - Check email notifications for scheduled maintenance

3. **Implement deployment strategies**:
   - Use staging environments for testing
   - Deploy during low-traffic periods
   - Have rollback plans ready

If build failures persist after platform updates complete:

1. **Verify project configuration**:

   ```yaml
   # Check your project settings
   visibility: public
   environment: development
   build_status: ready
   ```

2. **Clear build cache**:

   - Go to Project Settings
   - Navigate to Build Configuration
   - Select "Clear Build Cache"
   - Retry deployment

3. **Check resource quotas**:

   - Verify your account limits
   - Ensure sufficient build minutes available
   - Check storage quotas

4. **Contact support if needed**:
   - Provide specific error messages
   - Include project details and timing
   - Use "Reply to all" for faster resolution

<TroubleshootingItem id="monitoring-during-updates" summary="Monitoring services during updates">

During platform updates, monitor your services:

1. **Running services remain available**:

   - No downtime expected for active deployments
   - Existing applications continue running normally
   - Only new builds/deployments are affected

2. **Health check verification**:

   ```bash
   # Verify your services are still responding
   curl -I https://your-app.sleakops.dev
   # Should return 200 OK
   ```

3. **Log monitoring**:
   - Check application logs for any anomalies
   - Monitor resource usage during updates
   - Verify database connections remain stable
