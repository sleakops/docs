# DNS Resolution Issues for Public Deployments

**Date:** December 10, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** DNS, Deployment, Public, Domain, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** User creates a public deployment in SleakOps but the assigned domain is not resolving properly, preventing access to the deployed application.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Public deployment created successfully in SleakOps
- Domain URL is generated (e.g., https://site.develop.velo.la)
- DNS resolution fails when accessing the URL
- Application is not accessible via the public domain

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Deployment type: Public deployment
- Domain format: `https://[app].[environment].[domain].la`
- DNS provider: Managed by SleakOps
- SSL/TLS: HTTPS enabled

**Error Conditions:**

- DNS queries return no results or incorrect IP addresses
- Browser shows "This site can't be reached" or similar errors
- DNS propagation may still be in progress
- Issue occurs immediately after deployment creation

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="dns-propagation-wait" summary="Understanding DNS propagation delays">

DNS changes can take time to propagate across the internet:

- **Local DNS cache**: 5-15 minutes
- **ISP DNS servers**: 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Global propagation**: Up to 24-48 hours (rare)
- **Typical resolution time**: 15-30 minutes

This is normal behavior and not a platform issue.

<TroubleshootingItem id="verify-dns-status" summary="How to check DNS propagation status">

Use these tools to verify DNS propagation:

**Online DNS checkers:**

```bash
# Check from multiple locations
https://dnschecker.org/
https://www.whatsmydns.net/
```

**Command line tools:**

```bash
# Check DNS resolution
nslookup site.develop.velo.la

# Check from different DNS servers
nslookup site.develop.velo.la 8.8.8.8
nslookup site.develop.velo.la 1.1.1.1
```

**Expected result:**

```
Name:    site.develop.velo.la
Address: [IP_ADDRESS]
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="flush-dns-cache" summary="Clear local DNS cache">

If DNS has propagated but you still can't access the site:

**Windows:**

```cmd
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**macOS:**

```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
# or
sudo service nscd restart
```

**Browser cache:**

- Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
- Firefox: Settings → Privacy & Security → Clear Data

<TroubleshootingItem id="verify-deployment-status" summary="Verify deployment is running">

Ensure your deployment is actually running:

1. **Check deployment status in SleakOps dashboard:**

   - Go to your project
   - Verify deployment shows as "Running"
   - Check for any error messages

2. **Verify application logs:**

   ```bash
   # Check if application is starting correctly
   kubectl logs -f deployment/[your-app-name]
   ```

3. **Check service configuration:**
   - Ensure the service is exposed correctly
   - Verify port configuration matches your application

<TroubleshootingItem id="alternative-access-methods" summary="Alternative ways to test while DNS propagates">

While waiting for DNS propagation:

**1. Use direct IP access:**

```bash
# Get the load balancer IP
kubectl get services
# Access via IP: http://[EXTERNAL-IP]
```

**2. Modify local hosts file:**

```bash
# Add to /etc/hosts (Linux/Mac) or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows)
[EXTERNAL-IP] site.develop.velo.la
```

**3. Use kubectl port-forward:**

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/[service-name] 8080:80
# Access via http://localhost:8080
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting-steps" summary="Additional troubleshooting steps">

If DNS issues persist after 2 hours:

**1. Check domain configuration:**

- Verify the domain is correctly configured in SleakOps
- Ensure no typos in the domain name
- Check if custom domain settings are correct

**2. Verify SSL certificate:**

```bash
# Check SSL certificate status
openssl s_client -connect site.develop.velo.la:443 -servername site.develop.velo.la
```

**3. Contact support:**
If the issue persists beyond normal propagation times, contact SleakOps support with:

- Deployment name and project
- Expected domain URL
- DNS checker results
- Error messages or screenshots
