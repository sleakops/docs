# Project Stuck in Deleting State

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Project, Deletion, Troubleshooting, UI

## Problem Description

**Context:** User attempts to delete a project through the SleakOps platform interface, but the project remains visible in the Projects view with a "deleting" status indefinitely.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Project appears to be deleted successfully
- Project still visible in the Projects list
- Project status shows as "deleting" permanently
- UI does not reflect the actual deletion completion

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Project name: Can affect any project
- Platform: SleakOps web interface
- Action: Project deletion through UI

**Error Conditions:**

- Occurs after initiating project deletion
- Status remains "deleting" indefinitely
- Project resources may be actually deleted but UI state persists
- Refresh does not resolve the status

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="understanding-issue" summary="Understanding the deletion process">

When you delete a project in SleakOps, the system performs several cleanup operations:

1. **Resource cleanup**: Deletes all associated cloud resources (clusters, storage, etc.)
2. **Database cleanup**: Removes project records from the platform database
3. **UI state update**: Updates the interface to reflect the deletion

Sometimes the UI state update can lag behind the actual resource cleanup, causing the "deleting" status to persist.

If your project is stuck in "deleting" state:

1. **Wait for completion**: Large projects may take 10-15 minutes to fully delete
2. **Refresh the page**: Use Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) for a hard refresh
3. **Clear browser cache**: Clear your browser cache and cookies for the SleakOps domain
4. **Check in incognito/private mode**: Open SleakOps in an incognito window to verify the status

To confirm if your project is actually deleted:

1. **Check cloud provider console**:

   - AWS: Verify no resources remain in your account
   - Azure: Check resource groups are deleted
   - GCP: Confirm project resources are cleaned up

2. **Attempt to create a new project** with the same name:

   - If successful, the old project was actually deleted
   - If it fails due to name conflict, the project may still exist

3. **Contact support** if the issue persists after 30 minutes

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Ensure stable connection**: Maintain a stable internet connection during deletion
2. **Don't close the browser**: Keep the browser tab open until deletion completes
3. **Delete during off-peak hours**: Perform deletions when system load is lower
4. **Monitor resource cleanup**: Check your cloud provider console to confirm cleanup

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="when-to-contact-support" summary="When to contact support">

Contact SleakOps support if:

- Project remains in "deleting" state for more than 30 minutes
- Cloud resources are not being cleaned up
- You cannot create a new project with the same name
- The project reappears after seeming to be deleted

Provide this information when contacting support:

- Project name
