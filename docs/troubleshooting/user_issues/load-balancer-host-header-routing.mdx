# Load Balancer Host Header Routing Issue

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** Workload  
**Tags:** Load Balancer, Nginx, Host Header, Routing, Cloudflare

## Problem Description

**Context:** User has deployed an Nginx service listening on port 80, configured to serve content for specific domains ("velo.la" and "www.velo.la"). The service is accessible via the SleakOps-provided domain but returns HTTP 404 when accessed through custom domains via Cloudflare CNAME or direct host header manipulation.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Service works correctly when accessed via SleakOps domain: `main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la`
- HTTP 404 error when accessing via Cloudflare CNAME redirect from `velo.la` to the SleakOps domain
- HTTP 404 error when using `/etc/hosts` to point `velo.la` to the load balancer IP
- `curl -H "Host: velo.la"` returns HTTP 404, while direct curl to SleakOps domain returns 200 OK
- Nginx logs show requests arrive for direct domain access but not for custom host headers

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Service: Nginx listening on port 80
- Expected domains: `velo.la`, `www.velo.la`
- SleakOps domain: `main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la`
- DNS: Cloudflare CNAME pointing custom domains to SleakOps domain

**Error Conditions:**

- HTTP 404 occurs when Host header differs from the SleakOps-provided domain
- Load balancer appears to filter requests based on Host header
- Requests with custom Host headers don't reach the Nginx container

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="root-cause-analysis" summary="Understanding the root cause">

The issue occurs because SleakOps load balancers perform **host-based routing** by default. When you access the service using a custom domain (via Host header or CNAME), the load balancer doesn't recognize the custom domain and returns a 404 before the request reaches your Nginx container.

This is why:

- `curl https://main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la` works (recognized domain)
- `curl -H "Host: velo.la" https://main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la` fails (unrecognized domain)

<TroubleshootingItem id="configure-custom-domains" summary="Configure custom domains in SleakOps">

To fix this issue, you need to configure your custom domains in the SleakOps service configuration:

1. **Access your service configuration** in the SleakOps dashboard
2. **Navigate to the Networking section**
3. **Add custom domains** to the allowed hosts list:

```yaml
# Service configuration example
networking:
  public: true
  domains:
    - "main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la" # Default SleakOps domain
    - "velo.la" # Your custom domain
    - "www.velo.la" # Your www subdomain
  ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: HTTP
```

4. **Apply the configuration** and wait for the deployment to update

Ensure your Nginx configuration properly handles the custom domains:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name velo.la www.velo.la main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la;

    location / {
        # Your application configuration
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html index.htm;
    }
}
```

If you're using a custom Nginx configuration file, make sure it includes all the domains you want to serve.

<TroubleshootingItem id="cloudflare-configuration" summary="Cloudflare DNS configuration">

For Cloudflare configuration, ensure you're using the correct setup:

1. **CNAME Records:**

   - `velo.la` → `main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la`
   - `www.velo.la` → `main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la`

2. **SSL/TLS Settings:**

   - Set SSL/TLS encryption mode to **"Full"** or **"Full (strict)"**
   - Ensure **"Always Use HTTPS"** is enabled if needed

3. **Proxy Status:**
   - You can keep the orange cloud (proxied) enabled
   - Or disable it (gray cloud) for direct DNS resolution

<TroubleshootingItem id="testing-verification" summary="Testing and verification steps">

After configuring custom domains, test the setup:

1. **Test direct access:**

```bash
curl -v https://velo.la
curl -v https://www.velo.la
```

2. **Test with explicit Host header:**

```bash
curl -v -H "Host: velo.la" https://main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la
```

3. **Check service logs:**

```bash
# In SleakOps dashboard, check your service logs
# You should see requests arriving for all configured domains
```

4. **Verify DNS resolution:**

```bash
nslookup velo.la
nslookup www.velo.la
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="alternative-solutions" summary="Alternative solutions">

If you cannot configure custom domains in SleakOps, consider these alternatives:

1. **Use a reverse proxy:**
   Deploy a separate reverse proxy service that handles custom domains and forwards requests to your main service.

2. **Configure Nginx to accept any host:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    server_name _;

    location / {
        # Your application configuration
    }
}
```

3. **Use Cloudflare Workers:**
   Create a Cloudflare Worker to modify the Host header before forwarding requests.

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting-tips" summary="Additional troubleshooting tips">

**If the problem persists:**

1. **Check SleakOps service status** - Ensure the service is running and healthy
2. **Verify load balancer configuration** - Contact SleakOps support to verify load balancer settings
3. **Test with different tools:**

```bash
# Test with wget
wget --server-response --header="Host: velo.la" https://main-proxy.develop.us-east-2.velo.la

# Test with different User-Agent
curl -v -H "Host: velo.la" -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" https://main-proxy.develop.us
```
