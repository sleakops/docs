# AWS Password Reset Error for Team Members

**Date:** February 3, 2025  
**Category:** User  
**Tags:** AWS, Password, Reset, Member, Authentication

## Problem Description

**Context:** When attempting to reset the AWS password for a team member through the SleakOps platform, the operation fails and leaves the user in an inconsistent state.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Error message: "error resetting password" appears during the reset process
- User account gets stuck with "updating" label/status
- Password reset operation does not complete successfully
- User remains unable to access AWS resources

**Relevant Configuration:**

- User type: Team member (not admin)
- Operation: AWS password reset
- Platform: SleakOps user management interface
- User status: Stuck in "updating" state

**Error Conditions:**

- Error occurs during password reset initiation
- Affects team members specifically
- User account becomes locked in updating state
- Subsequent reset attempts may also fail

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-resolution" summary="Immediate steps to resolve the issue">

If you're experiencing this error, follow these steps:

1. **Wait for automatic recovery**: The system may automatically resolve the "updating" status within 5-10 minutes
2. **Refresh the user management page**: Sometimes the status update is delayed in the UI
3. **Contact support**: If the issue persists, provide the specific user email and timestamp of the error

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="root-cause-analysis" summary="Understanding why this error occurs">

This error typically happens due to:

1. **AWS IAM permission conflicts**: The service account may lack sufficient permissions to reset user passwords
2. **Concurrent operations**: Multiple password reset attempts happening simultaneously
3. **AWS service temporary unavailability**: Transient issues with AWS IAM service
4. **User state inconsistency**: The user account may be in an invalid state in AWS IAM

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="prevention-steps" summary="How to prevent this issue">

To avoid this problem in the future:

1. **Single reset attempt**: Only attempt one password reset at a time per user
2. **Wait between attempts**: If a reset fails, wait at least 5 minutes before trying again
3. **Check user status**: Ensure the user is in "active" status before attempting reset
4. **Verify permissions**: Ensure your admin account has proper permissions for user management

```bash
# Check if user is in proper state before reset
# This should be done through SleakOps UI
1. Navigate to Team Management
2. Locate the user
3. Verify status shows "Active" (not "Updating" or "Pending")
4. Then proceed with password reset
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="manual-resolution" summary="Manual resolution steps for admins">

If you're an admin and need to manually resolve this:

1. **Access the SleakOps admin panel**
2. **Navigate to User Management**
3. **Find the affected user**
4. **Check the user's current status**
5. **If stuck in 'updating', try these actions:**
   - Refresh the page and wait 2-3 minutes
   - Try to "cancel" the current operation if available
   - Contact SleakOps support with the user email and error details

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="alternative-solutions" summary="Alternative approaches">

If the standard reset continues to fail:

1. **Temporary workaround**: Create a new temporary user account for immediate access
2. **Direct AWS access**: If you have AWS console access, you can reset the password directly in IAM
3. **Remove and re-add user**: As a last resort, remove the user from the team and re-invite them

**Note**: Always coordinate with your team before removing users, as this may affect their access to projects and resources.
