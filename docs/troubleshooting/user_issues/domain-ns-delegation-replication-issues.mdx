# Domain NS Delegation Replication Issues

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Category:** General  
**Tags:** Domain, DNS, NS Records, Delegation, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** User is attempting to configure a custom domain (ordenapp.com.ar) in SleakOps but encounters NS (Name Server) delegation replication failures with their domain provider (DonWeb).

**Observed Symptoms:**

- NS delegation configuration failing at domain provider level
- Replication issues with delegated name servers
- Domain not resolving properly to SleakOps infrastructure
- Provider (DonWeb) acknowledging the technical issue

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Domain: ordenapp.com.ar (Argentine domain)
- Domain Provider: DonWeb
- Target Platform: SleakOps
- DNS Configuration: NS delegation setup

**Error Conditions:**

- NS record replication fails at provider level
- Domain delegation not propagating correctly
- Issue occurs during initial domain configuration
- Provider confirms technical problem on their end

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="understanding-ns-delegation" summary="Understanding NS delegation process">

NS (Name Server) delegation is the process where your domain provider points your domain to external name servers (in this case, SleakOps' DNS servers).

The process involves:

1. **SleakOps provides NS records** (e.g., ns1.sleakops.com, ns2.sleakops.com)
2. **You configure these at your domain provider** (DonWeb)
3. **Provider replicates the changes** to root DNS servers
4. **DNS propagation occurs globally** (24-48 hours)

While waiting for provider resolution:

1. **Verify NS records in SleakOps:**

   - Go to your project settings
   - Check the "Custom Domain" section
   - Note down the provided NS records

2. **Check current DNS status:**

   ```bash
   # Check current NS records
   dig NS ordenapp.com.ar

   # Check if domain resolves
   nslookup ordenapp.com.ar
   ```

3. **Verify provider configuration:**
   - Log into DonWeb control panel
   - Confirm NS records are correctly entered
   - Check for any error messages or warnings

When dealing with provider issues:

1. **Document the problem clearly:**

   - Provide exact NS records from SleakOps
   - Include screenshots of configuration
   - Note any error messages

2. **Request specific technical details:**

   - Ask for replication logs
   - Request timeline for resolution
   - Get confirmation of NS record acceptance

3. **Escalate if necessary:**
   - Request technical support escalation
   - Ask to speak with DNS/domain specialists
   - Consider temporary workarounds

If provider issues persist:

1. **Subdomain delegation:**

   ```
   # Instead of ordenapp.com.ar, use:
   app.ordenapp.com.ar
   ```

   Configure only the subdomain with SleakOps NS records.

2. **CNAME approach (if supported):**

   ```
   # Create CNAME record pointing to SleakOps
   www.ordenapp.com.ar CNAME your-app.sleakops.io
   ```

3. **Transfer domain to different provider:**

   - Consider providers with better DNS management
   - Popular options: Cloudflare, Route53, Namecheap

4. **Use SleakOps subdomain temporarily:**
   ```
   # Use provided subdomain while resolving
   your-app.sleakops.io
   ```

Once the provider resolves the replication issue:

1. **Check DNS propagation:**

   ```bash
   # Check NS records globally
   dig +trace NS ordenapp.com.ar

   # Verify from different locations
   nslookup ordenapp.com.ar 8.8.8.8
   nslookup ordenapp.com.ar 1.1.1.1
   ```

2. **Test domain resolution:**

   ```bash
   # Test HTTP resolution
   curl -I http://ordenapp.com.ar

   # Test HTTPS if configured
   curl -I https://ordenapp.com.ar
   ```

3. **Monitor propagation:**

   - Use online tools like whatsmydns.net
   - Check from multiple global locations
   - Allow 24-48 hours for full propagation

4. **Update SleakOps configuration:**
   - Confirm domain status in SleakOps dashboard
   - Test SSL certificate generation
   - Verify application accessibility

To avoid similar problems:

1. **Choose reliable DNS providers:**

   - Research provider DNS reliability
   - Check support quality and response times
   - Consider managed DNS services

2. **Document DNS configurations:**

   - Keep records of all NS configurations
   - Screenshot important settings
   - Maintain contact information for technical support

3. **Test in staging first:**

   - Use test subdomains before production
   - Verify DNS changes in non-critical environments
   - Have rollback plans ready

4. **Monitor DNS health:**
   - Set up monitoring for domain resolution
   - Use tools like UptimeRobot or Pingdom
   - Configure alerts for DNS failures
