# Job Management and Log Viewing

**Date:** February 4, 2025  
**Category:** Workload  
**Tags:** Jobs, Logs, Cleanup, Management, Execution

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to manage job executions in SleakOps, including cleaning up old job runs and viewing logs for both successful and failed job executions.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Job execution history accumulates over time with no cleanup option
- Logs are visible for failed jobs but not for successful ones
- Users cannot manually delete old job executions from the interface
- Job history becomes cluttered with old executions that are no longer relevant

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Platform: SleakOps job management interface
- Job types: All job types (scheduled, manual, etc.)
- Log visibility: Currently limited to failed executions

**Error Conditions:**

- No built-in cleanup mechanism for job history
- Inconsistent log viewing between successful and failed jobs
- Manual cleanup requires support team intervention

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="current-limitations" summary="Current job management limitations">

Currently, SleakOps has the following limitations in job management:

1. **No self-service cleanup**: Users cannot delete old job executions through the interface
2. **Limited log access**: Logs are automatically shown for failed jobs but not for successful ones
3. **Manual intervention required**: Cleanup requires contacting support for manual deletion

These are known limitations that are being addressed in future platform updates.

<TroubleshootingItem id="manual-cleanup-process" summary="How to request manual job cleanup">

To clean up old job executions:

1. **Contact Support**: Send an email to support@sleakops.com
2. **Specify jobs to delete**: Provide details about which job executions you want removed
3. **Include project context**: Mention your project name and job names
4. **Wait for confirmation**: Support team will manually remove the specified executions

**Email template:**

```
Subject: Job Execution Cleanup Request

Hi SleakOps Team,

I would like to request cleanup of old job executions for:

- Time range: [Optional: executions older than X days]

Thank you!
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="viewing-successful-job-logs" summary="How to view logs for successful jobs">

Currently, logs for successful jobs are not automatically displayed in the interface. To access them:

1. **Re-run the job**: Execute the same job with identical configuration
2. **Monitor during execution**: Watch the logs while the job is running
3. **Contact support**: Request specific log access for completed successful jobs

**Workaround for log retention:**

- Consider adding logging to external systems within your job scripts
- Use job output files that persist beyond execution
- Implement custom logging mechanisms in your job code

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="job-re-execution" summary="Re-executing jobs with same configuration">

To re-run a job with the same configuration:

1. **Navigate to Jobs section** in your SleakOps project
2. **Find the job** you want to re-execute
3. **Click on the job name** to view details
4. **Use the "Run Again" or "Execute" button** (if available)
5. **Verify configuration** matches your previous execution
6. **Monitor logs** during execution to capture output

If the re-execution option is not available in the interface, you may need to:

- Recreate the job configuration manually
- Use the same parameters and settings as the previous execution

<TroubleshootingItem id="best-practices" summary="Best practices for job management">

**For better job management:**

1. **Regular cleanup**: Request cleanup monthly or quarterly
2. **Meaningful job names**: Use descriptive names to identify jobs easily
3. **External logging**: Implement logging to external systems for long-term retention
4. **Documentation**: Keep track of important job configurations externally

**For log management:**

1. **Capture during execution**: Monitor jobs while they run to see output
2. **Export important logs**: Save critical log information externally
3. **Use job outputs**: Design jobs to write important results to files
4. **Implement notifications**: Set up alerts for job completion status

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="upcoming-improvements" summary="Planned platform improvements">

SleakOps is working on implementing the following job management features:

1. **Self-service cleanup**: Users will be able to delete old job executions
2. **Enhanced log viewing**: Logs will be accessible for both successful and failed jobs
3. **Job history management**: Better filtering and organization of job executions
4. **Log retention policies**: Configurable log retention settings

These improvements are planned for future releases to enhance the user experience.
