# VPN Connection Disconnection Issues

**Date:** August 1, 2024  
**Category:** User  
**Tags:** VPN, Connection, Credentials, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users experience intermittent VPN disconnections when accessing SleakOps services, requiring credential updates and reconnection to restore access to internal resources like Grafana dashboards.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- VPN connection drops unexpectedly
- Unable to access internal services (e.g., Grafana ingress)
- Connection issues resolved after credential update
- Services work correctly when VPN is properly connected

**Relevant Configuration:**

- VPN client: SleakOps provided VPN configuration
- Target services: Internal ingress endpoints (e.g., Grafana)
- Authentication: User credentials for VPN access

**Error Conditions:**

- VPN disconnects without user action
- Internal services become inaccessible
- Reconnection may fail with old credentials
- Issue resolves after credential refresh

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-reconnection" summary="Immediate reconnection steps">

When experiencing VPN disconnection:

1. **Disconnect completely** from the VPN
2. **Wait 10-15 seconds** before attempting to reconnect
3. **Reconnect to the VPN** using your client
4. **Test access** to internal services

If reconnection fails, proceed to credential update steps.

After reconnecting, verify your access:

1. **Check VPN status**

   ```bash
   # Check your IP address
   curl ifconfig.me

   # Should show SleakOps VPN IP range
   ```

2. **Test internal service access**

   ```bash
   # Test Grafana access (example)
   curl -I https://grafana.prod.your-domain.com/login

   # Should return HTTP 200 or redirect
   ```

3. **Verify DNS resolution**
   ```bash
   # Test internal DNS resolution
   nslookup grafana.prod.your-domain.com
   ```

To minimize VPN disconnections:

1. **Enable auto-reconnect** in your VPN client settings
2. **Use keep-alive options** if available
3. **Check network stability** on your local connection
4. **Update VPN client** to the latest version

**For OpenVPN clients:**

```conf
# Add to your .ovpn file
keepalive 10 120
ping-timer-rem
persist-tun
persist-key
```

**For network administrators:**

- Configure firewall to allow VPN traffic
- Ensure UDP port 1194 (or configured port) is open
- Check for network equipment that might drop long connections

**If problems persist:**

1. **Check system logs**

   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   tail -f /var/log/openvpn.log

   # On Windows
   # Check Event Viewer > Applications and Services Logs > OpenVPN
   ```

2. **Test different connection methods**

   - Try TCP instead of UDP
   - Use different VPN server endpoints if available
   - Test from different network locations

3. **Contact support with details**
   - VPN client version
   - Operating system
   - Error messages from logs
   - Time when disconnection occurred
