# Web Service Alias Configuration

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Category:** Workload  
**Tags:** Web Service, Alias, Configuration, Networking

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to create custom domain aliases for their web services in SleakOps to provide alternative URLs or custom domain names for accessing their applications.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Need for custom domain names for web services
- Requirement to access services through multiple URLs
- Desire to use branded or user-friendly domain names
- Need for load balancing across multiple endpoints

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Web service deployment in SleakOps
- Custom domain names or subdomains
- DNS configuration requirements
- SSL/TLS certificate management

**Error Conditions:**

- Default service URLs may not meet branding requirements
- Multiple access points needed for the same service
- Custom domain routing requirements

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="alias-creation" summary="How to create aliases for web services">

To create aliases for your web services in SleakOps:

1. **Navigate to Web Service Details**:

   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Select the web service you want to configure
   - Click on the web service name to access its details

2. **Access Alias Configuration**:

   - In the web service detail page, look for the "Aliases" or "Networking" section
   - Click on "Add Alias" or similar button

3. **Configure the Alias**:
   - Enter your custom domain name (e.g., `api.mycompany.com`)
   - Select the appropriate protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
   - Configure any additional routing rules if needed

<TroubleshootingItem id="dns-configuration" summary="DNS configuration requirements">

Before creating an alias, ensure your DNS is properly configured:

1. **CNAME Record**: Create a CNAME record pointing your custom domain to the SleakOps service endpoint
2. **A Record**: Alternatively, use an A record pointing to the service IP address
3. **Verification**: Ensure DNS propagation is complete before testing

```bash
# Example DNS configuration
# CNAME record
api.mycompany.com.    IN    CNAME    your-service.sleakops.io.

# Or A record
api.mycompany.com.    IN    A        192.168.1.100
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="ssl-certificates" summary="SSL certificate management">

For HTTPS aliases, SleakOps can automatically manage SSL certificates:

1. **Automatic Certificates**: SleakOps can automatically provision Let's Encrypt certificates
2. **Custom Certificates**: Upload your own SSL certificates if required
3. **Certificate Renewal**: Automatic renewal is handled by the platform

**Steps to enable HTTPS**:

- Enable SSL/TLS in the alias configuration
- Choose between automatic or custom certificate
- Verify certificate installation after creation

<TroubleshootingItem id="multiple-aliases" summary="Managing multiple aliases">

You can create multiple aliases for the same web service:

1. **Different Domains**: Point multiple domains to the same service
2. **Subdomain Routing**: Use different subdomains for different purposes
3. **Environment-specific**: Create aliases for different environments

**Example use cases**:

- `api.mycompany.com` - Production API
- `api-staging.mycompany.com` - Staging environment
- `v1.api.mycompany.com` - Version-specific endpoint

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting" summary="Common troubleshooting steps">

If your alias is not working properly:

1. **DNS Propagation**: Wait for DNS changes to propagate (up to 48 hours)
2. **Certificate Issues**: Check SSL certificate status and validity
3. **Firewall Rules**: Ensure no firewall rules are blocking the traffic
4. **Service Health**: Verify the underlying web service is running correctly

**Verification commands**:

```bash
# Check DNS resolution
nslookup api.mycompany.com

# Test HTTP connectivity
curl -I http://api.mycompany.com

# Test HTTPS connectivity
curl -I https://api.mycompany.com
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="best-practices" summary="Best practices for alias configuration">

**Naming Conventions**:

- Use descriptive subdomain names
- Follow consistent naming patterns
- Consider environment prefixes (prod-, staging-, dev-)

**Security Considerations**:

- Always use HTTPS for production services
- Implement proper certificate management
- Consider using wildcard certificates for multiple subdomains

**Performance Optimization**:

- Use CDN integration when available
- Configure appropriate caching headers
- Monitor alias performance and usage
