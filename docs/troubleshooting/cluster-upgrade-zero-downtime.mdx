# Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade with Zero Downtime

**Date:** February 19, 2025  
**Category:** Cluster  
**Tags:** Upgrade, Kubernetes, Downtime, Maintenance, Production

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to upgrade their Kubernetes clusters in SleakOps but are concerned about potential downtime during critical business hours, especially during high-traffic periods or end-of-month operations.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Concern about service interruption during cluster upgrades
- Need to schedule upgrades during low-traffic hours
- Uncertainty about the upgrade process and its impact
- Questions about self-service upgrade capabilities

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Production clusters with multiple replicas
- Web services and workers with high availability requirements
- Critical business operations during specific time windows
- Deployment policies configured for rolling updates

**Error Conditions:**

- Risk of downtime during business-critical hours
- Potential service degradation during upgrade process
- Need for immediate support if issues arise during upgrade

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="zero-downtime-theory" summary="Understanding Zero-Downtime Upgrades">

SleakOps implements zero-downtime cluster upgrades through:

1. **Rolling Node Updates**: Nodes are rotated gradually, not all at once
2. **Deployment Policies**: 33% of each deployment must remain active during upgrades
3. **Pod Distribution**: Services are distributed across multiple nodes
4. **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring ensures service availability

**Requirements for Zero Downtime:**

- Production mode cluster
- At least 2 replicas per web service or worker
- Proper resource allocation and pod anti-affinity rules

<TroubleshootingItem id="self-service-upgrade" summary="How to Perform Self-Service Upgrades">

To run the upgrade yourself:

1. **Access the Console**: Go to your cluster's settings page
2. **Navigate to General Settings**: Find the upgrade section
3. **Review Upgrade Details**: Check the target version and changes
4. **Initiate Upgrade**: Click the upgrade button when ready

**Console Path:**

```
SleakOps Console → Clusters → [Your Cluster] → Settings → General Settings
```

**Best Practices:**

- Schedule during low-traffic hours (early morning recommended)
- Notify your team before starting
- Monitor application logs during the process
- Have rollback plan ready if needed

<TroubleshootingItem id="upgrade-monitoring" summary="Monitoring During Upgrades">

During the upgrade process, monitor:

1. **Application Health**: Check your application endpoints
2. **Pod Status**: Ensure pods are being recreated successfully
3. **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory during transition
4. **Logs**: Watch for any error messages in application logs

**Key Indicators of Successful Upgrade:**

- All pods show "Running" status
- Application endpoints respond normally
- No error spikes in monitoring dashboards
- Database connections remain stable

<TroubleshootingItem id="timing-considerations" summary="When to Schedule Upgrades">

**Recommended Timing:**

- Early morning hours (2-6 AM local time)
- Weekends or maintenance windows
- Avoid end-of-month or high-traffic periods
- Consider time zones for global applications

**Pre-Upgrade Checklist:**

- [ ] Verify cluster has multiple replicas
- [ ] Check recent application deployments are stable
- [ ] Ensure monitoring is active
- [ ] Notify relevant team members
- [ ] Plan for immediate support if needed
