# Project Deletion and Dependencies Behavior

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Project, Dependencies, Redis, Deletion, Cleanup

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to understand the behavior of project dependencies (such as Redis, databases, caches) when a project is deleted from the SleakOps platform.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Uncertainty about dependency cleanup when deleting projects
- Need to understand if dependencies are automatically removed
- Concern about data loss or orphaned resources
- Questions about cleanup procedures

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Project with attached dependencies (Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- SleakOps project management interface
- Dependency lifecycle management

**Error Conditions:**

- Risk of orphaned resources if dependencies aren't properly cleaned up
- Potential data loss if dependencies are unexpectedly deleted
- Billing concerns for unused resources

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="dependency-deletion-behavior" summary="What happens to dependencies when deleting a project">

**Yes, dependencies are automatically deleted when you delete a project in SleakOps.**

When you delete a project that contains dependencies like Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other services, the following occurs:

1. **All project dependencies are removed** along with the project
2. **Data stored in these dependencies is permanently deleted**
3. **Associated cloud resources are cleaned up** to avoid ongoing charges
4. **The deletion is irreversible** - you cannot recover the data afterward

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="deletion-process" summary="Step-by-step deletion process">

The deletion process follows this sequence:

1. **Project deletion initiated** by user
2. **Workloads are stopped** (webservices, workers, cron jobs)
3. **Dependencies are identified** and marked for deletion
4. **Data backup warning** is displayed (if applicable)
5. **Dependencies are deleted** in reverse dependency order
6. **Project resources are cleaned up**
7. **Confirmation of complete deletion**

```bash
# Example of what gets deleted:
- Redis instance and all cached data
- PostgreSQL database and all stored data
- MySQL database and all stored data
- Associated volumes and storage
- Network configurations
- Load balancers and ingress rules
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="data-backup-recommendations" summary="Data backup recommendations before deletion">

**Important: Always backup critical data before deleting a project.**

### For Redis:

```bash
# Connect to your Redis instance and create a backup
redis-cli --rdb /path/to/backup.rdb

# Or export specific keys
redis-cli --scan --pattern "*" | xargs redis-cli MGET
```

### For PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Create a database dump
pg_dump -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database > backup.sql

# Or use SleakOps CLI if available
sleakops project backup --project-id PROJECT_ID --service postgres
```

### For MySQL:

```bash
# Create a database dump
mysqldump -h your-host -u your-user -p your-database > backup.sql
```

### Before Deleting a Project:

1. **Review all dependencies**:

   - Go to Project Settings → Dependencies
   - List all attached services (Redis, databases, etc.)
   - Identify critical data that needs backup

2. **Create backups**:

   - Export important data from Redis
   - Dump database contents
   - Save configuration files

3. **Consider alternatives**:
   - **Pause the project** instead of deleting (if available)
   - **Migrate dependencies** to another project
   - **Detach dependencies** before deletion (if supported)

### Safety Checklist:

- [ ] All critical data has been backed up
- [ ] Team members are aware of the deletion
- [ ] No active users depend on the services
- [ ] Alternative solutions are in place if needed

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="recovery-options" summary="Recovery options after accidental deletion">

**Unfortunately, once a project and its dependencies are deleted, recovery is generally not possible.**

However, check these options:

1. **Cloud provider backups**: Some cloud providers maintain automatic backups
2. **SleakOps support**: Contact support immediately if deletion was accidental
3. **Application-level backups**: Check if your application created its own backups

### Prevention for the future:

- Set up regular automated backups
- Use staging environments for testing deletions
- Implement backup strategies in your application code
- Consider using external backup services
