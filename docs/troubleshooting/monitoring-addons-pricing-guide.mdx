# Monitoring Addons Pricing Guide

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Category:** General  
**Tags:** Pricing, Monitoring, Grafana, Loki, KubeCost, OpenTelemetry, Addons

## Problem Description

**Context:** Users need to understand the pricing structure for monitoring and observability addons in SleakOps, including individual component costs and dependencies.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Need for cost estimation before implementing monitoring stack
- Uncertainty about individual addon pricing
- Questions about dependencies between monitoring components
- Confusion about what drives the actual costs

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Monitoring stack: Grafana + Loki + KubeCost + OpenTelemetry
- Log retention: 14 days (configurable)
- Infrastructure: Spot instances within existing cluster
- Database: RDS required for Grafana

**Error Conditions:**

- Budget planning without clear cost breakdown
- Potential over-provisioning due to lack of pricing transparency
- Difficulty in justifying monitoring investments

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="individual-pricing" summary="Individual Addon Pricing Breakdown">

**Current Monitoring Addon Prices (Approximate):**

- **Grafana**: $20 USD/month
- **Loki**: $10 USD/month
- **KubeCost**: $10 USD/month
- **OpenTelemetry**: $10 USD/month (upcoming addon)

**Important Notes:**

- Loki requires Grafana to be installed first
- Total cost for complete monitoring stack: ~$40-50 USD/month
- Prices are approximate and may vary based on usage

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="cost-structure" summary="Understanding the Cost Structure">

**Fixed Costs:**

- **RDS Database**: Required for Grafana (main fixed cost component)

**Variable Costs:**

- **Compute Resources**: Run on spot instances within your existing cluster
- **Storage**: S3 buckets for log and metrics retention
- **Network**: Data transfer costs (minimal)

**Cost Optimization:**

- Monitoring addons share instances with Essential addons
- In many cases, no new instances are needed
- Spot instances significantly reduce compute costs

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="dependencies" summary="Addon Dependencies and Requirements">

**Required Dependencies:**

1. **Grafana** (standalone)

   - Requires: RDS database
   - Cost: $20 USD/month

2. **Loki** (log aggregation)

   - Requires: Grafana must be installed first
   - Additional cost: $10 USD/month
   - Combined with Grafana: $30 USD/month

3. **KubeCost** (cost monitoring)

   - Can be installed independently
   - Cost: $10 USD/month

4. **OpenTelemetry** (upcoming)
   - Part of observability stack
   - Estimated cost: $10 USD/month

<TroubleshootingItem id="retention-benefits" summary="Data Retention Advantages">

**SleakOps Retention Benefits:**

- **Standard retention**: 14 days (included in base price)
- **Extended retention**: Up to 3 months with minimal cost increase
- **Storage location**: S3 buckets (cost-effective)
- **No performance impact**: Historical data doesn't affect cluster performance

**Comparison with other solutions:**

```yaml
# Traditional monitoring (expensive)
retention_days: 14
storage_type: "cluster-local"
cost_increase: "linear with retention"

# SleakOps approach (cost-effective)
retention_days: 90
storage_type: "s3-bucket"
cost_increase: "minimal"
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="planning-recommendations" summary="Cost Planning Recommendations">

**For Budget Planning:**

1. **Minimum monitoring setup**:

   - Grafana only: $20 USD/month
   - Good for basic metrics visualization

2. **Standard monitoring setup**:

   - Grafana + Loki: $30 USD/month
   - Includes log aggregation and analysis

3. **Complete monitoring setup**:

   - Grafana + Loki + KubeCost: $40 USD/month
   - Full observability with cost tracking

4. **Future-ready setup**:
   - All addons + OpenTelemetry: $50 USD/month
   - Complete observability and tracing

**Cost Optimization Tips:**

- Start with essential addons to share compute resources
- Monitor actual usage before adding more components
- Take advantage of S3 storage for long-term retention
- Consider seasonal usage patterns for cost planning
