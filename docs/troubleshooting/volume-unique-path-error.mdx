# Volume Unique Path Error After Deletion

**Date:** February 11, 2025  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Volume, Storage, Error, Mount Point, Deletion

## Problem Description

**Context:** User attempts to recreate a volume at the same mount point after deleting a previous volume, but encounters a "Unique path" error in SleakOps platform.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- "Unique path" error when trying to create a new volume
- Error occurs at the same mount point where a volume was previously deleted
- Volume appears to be properly deleted from the interface
- Unable to reuse the same mount path for new volumes

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Project: "velo-opensactions"
- Mount path: "/opensanctions/data"
- Volume was previously created and then deleted
- Attempting to recreate volume at identical mount point

**Error Conditions:**

- Error appears during volume creation process
- Occurs specifically when reusing mount paths
- Persists even after volume deletion appears successful
- May indicate incomplete cleanup of volume resources

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="root-cause" summary="Understanding the root cause">

The "Unique path" error typically occurs when:

1. **Incomplete volume cleanup**: The volume deletion process didn't fully remove all associated resources
2. **Mount point reservation**: The system still considers the mount path as "in use"
3. **Resource synchronization delay**: There's a delay between volume deletion and path availability
4. **Orphaned references**: Database entries or metadata still reference the deleted volume

This is a known issue that has been identified and fixed in recent platform updates.

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-workaround" summary="Immediate workaround solutions">

While waiting for the fix to be applied, you can use these workarounds:

**Option 1: Use a different mount path**

```bash
# Instead of /opensanctions/data
# Try /opensanctions/data-v2 or /opensanctions/storage
```

**Option 2: Wait and retry**

- Wait 10-15 minutes after volume deletion
- The system may eventually release the path reservation
- Retry volume creation with the same path

**Option 3: Contact support for manual cleanup**

- If the path must be reused immediately
- Support team can manually clean up orphaned references

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Verify complete deletion**:

   - Check that no workloads are still using the volume
   - Ensure all pods using the volume are stopped

2. **Wait before recreation**:

   - Allow 5-10 minutes between deletion and recreation
   - This ensures all cleanup processes complete

3. **Use unique mount paths**:
   - Consider using timestamps or version numbers in paths
   - Example: `/data/app-v1`, `/data/app-v2`

<TroubleshootingItem id="verification-steps" summary="How to verify volume is completely deleted">

To confirm a volume is fully deleted:

1. **Check the Volumes section**:

   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Navigate to Storage → Volumes
   - Verify the volume is not listed

2. **Check workload configurations**:

   - Review all workloads in the project
   - Ensure no workload references the deleted volume
   - Look for any "Volume not found" errors

3. **Monitor for orphaned resources**:
   - Check if any persistent volume claims remain
   - Verify no storage classes are still referencing the volume
