# CI/CD Pipeline Not Triggering on Branch Push

**Date:** March 14, 2024  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** CI/CD, Pipeline, Git, Deployment, Troubleshooting

## Problem Description

**Context:** User pushes code changes to a development branch but the CI/CD pipeline doesn't automatically trigger to create new container images and deploy updates to the environment.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Code pushes to dev branch don't trigger pipeline execution
- New container images are not being built automatically
- Deployments don't update with the latest code changes
- Pipeline appears to be inactive or misconfigured

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Target branch: Development branch (e.g., `dev`, `develop`)
- Repository: Git-based source control
- Pipeline: SleakOps CI/CD integration
- Expected behavior: Automatic build and deployment on push

**Error Conditions:**

- Pipeline doesn't trigger after git push
- No build activity visible in project dashboard
- Deployment remains on previous version
- No error messages or pipeline logs generated

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="branch-configuration" summary="Verify Target Branch Configuration">

First, ensure your project is configured to watch the correct branch:

1. Navigate to **Project > Settings > General Config**
2. Check the **Target Branch** setting
3. Verify it matches the branch you're pushing to (e.g., `dev`, `develop`, `main`)
4. Save changes if you need to update the branch name

**Common Issues:**

- Project configured for `main` but pushing to `dev`
- Branch name mismatch (e.g., `develop` vs `development`)
- Case sensitivity issues in branch names

<TroubleshootingItem id="pipeline-yaml-setup" summary="Configure Pipeline YAML File">

Ensure your repository has a properly configured pipeline file:

1. Go to **Project > Settings > Git Pipelines**
2. Review the YAML example provided
3. Create or update your pipeline file in your repository
4. Common file names: `.sleakops.yml`, `.sleakops/pipeline.yml`

**Example Pipeline Configuration:**

```yaml
version: "1"
pipeline:
  triggers:
    - branch: dev
      on: push
  stages:
    - name: build
      steps:
        - name: build-image
          action: docker-build
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
    - name: deploy
      steps:
        - name: deploy-to-dev
          action: deploy
          environment: development
```

**Key Points:**

- Ensure the `branch` in triggers matches your target branch
- Include both `build` and `deploy` stages
- Verify the pipeline file is in the repository root or `.sleakops/` directory

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="api-key-setup" summary="Configure SLEAKOPS_KEY Variable">

Set up the required API key for pipeline authentication:

1. Go to **Settings > CLI** in your SleakOps dashboard
2. Generate or copy your API key
3. In your Git repository settings, add a new environment variable:
   - **Name:** `SLEAKOPS_KEY`
   - **Value:** Your API key from step 2
   - **Scope:** Available to pipeline/CI processes

**For Different Git Providers:**

**GitHub:**

- Go to Repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
- Add new repository secret: `SLEAKOPS_KEY`

**GitLab:**

- Go to Project > Settings > CI/CD > Variables
- Add variable: `SLEAKOPS_KEY` (mark as protected if needed)

**Bitbucket:**

- Go to Repository > Repository settings > Pipelines > Repository variables
- Add variable: `SLEAKOPS_KEY`

<TroubleshootingItem id="verification-steps" summary="Verify Configuration and Test">

After completing the setup, verify everything is working:

1. **Check Pipeline Status:**

   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Look for pipeline activity in the **Deployments** or **Builds** section

2. **Test with a Small Change:**

   - Make a minor change to your code
   - Commit and push to your target branch
   - Monitor the pipeline execution

3. **Review Logs:**

   - Check pipeline logs for any error messages
   - Verify build and deployment steps are executing

4. **Common Verification Points:**
   - Pipeline file is committed to the repository
   - Branch names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - API key is valid and has necessary permissions
   - Repository webhook is configured (usually automatic)

</TroubleshootingItem>

<TroubleshootingItem id="troubleshooting-tips" summary="Additional Troubleshooting Tips">

If the pipeline still doesn't trigger:

**Check Webhook Configuration:**

- Verify your Git provider has the correct webhook URL
- Test webhook delivery in your Git provider's settings

**Validate API Key Permissions:**

- Ensure the API key has project deployment permissions
- Try regenerating the API key if it's old

**Review Pipeline Syntax:**

- Validate YAML syntax using an online YAML validator
- Check for indentation errors in the pipeline file

**Contact Support:**
If issues persist, provide the following information:

- Project name and ID
- Target branch name
- Recent commit SHA that should have triggered the pipeline
- Any error messages from the dashboard
