# Project Creation Error with Branch Names Containing Special Characters

**Date:** February 19, 2025  
**Category:** Project  
**Tags:** Project, Repository, Branch, Validation, Git

## Problem Description

**Context:** User attempts to create a new project in SleakOps based on a Git repository but encounters validation errors when the branch name contains special characters or specific naming patterns.

**Observed Symptoms:**

- Interface error when trying to create a project from a repository
- Error occurs specifically with branch names containing forward slashes
- Branch name format: `feature/SITE-1` triggers validation error
- Project creation process fails at the branch selection step

**Relevant Configuration:**

- Branch name: `feature/SITE-1`
- Action: Creating new project from repository
- Platform: SleakOps web interface
- Repository type: Git repository

**Error Conditions:**

- Error appears during project creation wizard
- Occurs when branch names contain forward slashes (`/`)
- Validation error prevents project creation completion
- Issue affects branch selection in the interface

## Detailed Solution

<TroubleshootingItem id="immediate-workaround" summary="Immediate workaround solution">

While the SleakOps team works on fixing the validation issue, you can use this temporary workaround:

1. **Change the branch name temporarily** in your repository:

   - Rename `feature/SITE-1` to something like `feature-SITE-1` or `featureSITE1`
   - Use only alphanumeric characters and hyphens/underscores

2. **Create the project** with the renamed branch

3. **Use manual build specification** when needed:
   - During build process, you can manually specify the original branch name
   - This allows you to work with your original branch structure

When you need to build from your original branch:

1. Go to your project's **Build** section
2. Select **Manual Build** option
3. In the build configuration, specify the branch name manually:
   ```
   Branch: feature/SITE-1
   ```
4. Proceed with the build process

**Note:** This workaround works for manual builds but won't work for continuous integration until the platform fix is implemented.

To avoid similar issues in the future, consider these branch naming conventions:

**Recommended formats:**

- `feature-SITE-1`
- `feature_SITE_1`
- `featureSITE1`
- `site1-feature`

**Avoid these characters in branch names:**

- Forward slashes (`/`)
- Special characters that might cause URL encoding issues
- Spaces or other whitespace characters

**Git branch naming that works well with SleakOps:**

```bash
# Good examples
git checkout -b feature-user-authentication
git checkout -b bugfix-login-error
git checkout -b hotfix-security-patch

# Avoid these patterns
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git checkout -b bug/fix-login
```

<TroubleshootingItem id="continuous-integration-considerations" summary="Continuous Integration limitations">

**Current limitations:**

- Continuous integration will not work with the workaround
- Automated builds will fail until the platform fix is deployed
- Manual intervention required for each build

**When the fix is available:**

- Branch names with forward slashes will be supported
- Continuous integration will resume normal operation
- No changes needed to existing project configuration

**Timeline:**

- The SleakOps team has added this issue to their backlog
- Fix priority depends on deployment schedule and user needs
- Contact support if you need this resolved before production deployment

<TroubleshootingItem id="alternative-git-workflow" summary="Alternative Git workflow">

If you frequently use feature branches with slashes, consider this workflow:

1. **Keep your development branches** with original naming
2. **Create deployment branches** with SleakOps-friendly names:

   ```bash
   # Your development branch
   git checkout feature/SITE-1

   # Create deployment branch
   git checkout -b deploy-SITE-1
   git push origin deploy-SITE-1
   ```

3. **Use deployment branches** for SleakOps projects
4. **Merge changes** from feature branches to deployment branches as needed
