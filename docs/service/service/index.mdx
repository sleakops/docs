# Services

In modern web and application infrastructure, continuous and reliable operation is paramount. The "Services" category encompasses entities that are always running, ensuring the smooth functioning and interaction of different components. This category is further divided into two subgroups: Web Services and Workers.

## Web Service

### Description
Web Services are the backbone of any online platform. They provide the interfaces and endpoints that users, other services, and applications interact with. Whether it's serving web pages, handling API requests, or managing user authentication, a Web Service is always on, always listening, and always responding.

### Usage
Typically, when a user accesses an application, their requests are directed to a Web Service. This service processes the request, interacts with databases or other services if necessary, and then returns the required response. Web Services must be scalable and robust, capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

## Worker

### Description
Workers, in the context of web and application infrastructure, are services that perform tasks in the background. Unlike Web Services, which primarily respond to external requests, Workers are internally focused. They handle tasks like data processing, sending email notifications, data backup, and more. These tasks are essential but don't need to be performed in real-time or in direct response to a user's action.

### Usage
Workers operate behind the scenes. For instance, when a user uploads a large video to a platform, instead of making them wait for it to be processed, a Worker will take on this task. The user can continue using the application while the video is being processed in the background. Once complete, the user might receive a notification, another task that a Worker could handle.
