# Jobs

In the context of web and application infrastructure, the term "Job" refers to a specific task scheduled for execution. These tasks can vary based on their purpose and timing of execution. Here, we break down the concept of "Job" into three essential subgroups: Jobs, Cronjobs, and Hooks.

## Jobs

### Description
A "Job" refers to a simple command that is launched in a terminal. This task executes once and performs a specific function within the system or application. It's often used for on-the-spot operations such as updates, system checks, or maintenance tasks.

### Usage
To execute a Job, simply input the desired command into the terminal and wait for the task to complete.

## Cronjobs

### Description
A "Cronjob" is a specialized variant of a Job. Instead of executing just once, a Cronjob is scheduled to run at defined regular intervals. For instance, it could be set to run daily at 3 a.m., weekly, or monthly.

### Usage
To set up a Cronjob, you'll need to specify the command to run and the time interval in which you want it to repeat. This configuration ensures the system performs the task automatically without manual intervention.

## Hooks

### Description
A "Hook" is a command that gets triggered and executed in response to a specific event. For example, a Hook might be set to run every time a user registers on an application or when a database updates.

### Usage
To implement a Hook, you first define the event that will trigger the command. Then, link this event to the specific command you want to run. In this way, each time the event occurs, the system will automatically execute the associated Hook.
