# Environment

An environment is an abstraction that let us isolate the different resources managed by SleakOps.
This isolation is based on criteria established by the users that can respond to different configurations and purposes.
It helps in reproducing settings and assigning different responsibilities for each one of these environments.

Some common use cases are to create environments based on the lifecycle of an application.
This case might be implemented by creating environments for developers (dev), quality assurance (qa), stagging (stg) and production (prod).
Each of these might have custom settings appropriate for the needs of different roles, such as developers and testers.
Environments are independent of one another.

A cluster must be selected to create an environment, hence that according to our [proposed architecture](/docs/provider/aws.mdx) the prod account must only contain production environments.
The dev account must host all other non-productive environments.

## Infrastructure created with an environment

For an environment to properly function it needs DNS resolution, so when an environment is created a secondary hosted zone is also created in the Route 53 service. Remember that the primary one was created during the [Provider](/docs/provider) creation and assigned to the prod account.

## Relationship with Projects

Environment and projects are closely related as every matching between two might represent a namespace.
Namespaces are resources represented in SleakOps, sometimes referred to as project_env.
Namespace creation is triggered with the creation of [services](/docs/service/index.mdx) or [dependencies](/docs/dependency/index.mdx) resources.

This namespace requires SleakOps to create:

- A proper namespace inside the Kubernetes cluster of the environment.
- A Kubernetes job to perform the [initial build image](/docs/project/initial-build.mdx).

### Pricing

In AWS the billing for environments is related to the [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) service.

In summary, the approximate cost is:

- $0.50 for the hosted zone per month.
- $0.40 per million queries.
