# Navigate in Sleakops

## Account Selector

After creating your first Cloud Provider, you will encounter a screen very similar to this one, where you will need to choose the "Account" you will work in (also known as development environments).

If you want to have a better understanding of how Sleakops manages its architecture, you can review the [Architecture Overview](/provider/awsprovider/aws).

For this, you can access the account selector located in the upper section of the Sidebar.

    alt="Account Selector"
    style={{ height: '250px', width: 'auto' }}
  />
</Zoom>

## Sidebar

After selecting the account, the options for navigating through the different resources that you are capable of deploying using Sleakops will be enabled. At a glance, two groups can be observed. The first group, composed of Clusters, Environments, and Projects, refers to first-level resources, which are necessary to deploy second-level resources such as Dependencies, Services, Jobs, Vargroups, Build, or Deployments.

## Sidebar Footer

Hacia el final del Sidebar se encuentran las opciones encargadas de la gestion de usuarios, de cloud providers y de gestion de sesion.

## Workspace

Upon your first entry into Sleakops, you will find shortcuts to information and buttons that help access the most commonly used tools quickly, such as the current and projected costs within the infrastructure, access to the VPN, quick access to the company's personal AWS account, the creation and management of Hosted Zones, etc.
