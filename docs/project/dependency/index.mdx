### What happens when I delete a dependency?
</summary>
By deleting a dependency, SleakOps will remove all the information related to it and all what is related to it will stop working. To solve that SleakOps create a Deployment in PENDING_APPROVAL status, that must be run manually ASAP to stop the downtime. 
In case you delete a database, SleakOps will generate a final snapshot before its deletion.
