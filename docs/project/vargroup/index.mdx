# VariableGroups

A **Vargroup** in SleakOps is a resource that securely stores sensitive information (like database credentials) within your EKS cluster. It ensures that credentials and environment-specific variables are securely managed and easily accessible by your applications.

### What is the difference between a Global and a Service-Scoped Vargroup?
</summary>
- **Global**: Available to all services within the namespace. It is created without selecting a specific service. To create them select “global” 
- **Service-Scoped Variable Group**: Only applies to the selected service within the project and environment. It overrides global var group values if they have the same key.

<summary>
### What happens if there are duplicate keys in different Vargroups?
</summary>
If duplicate keys exist across different var groups:
- If the key exists in both a global and a service-scoped var group, the service-scoped value takes precedence. 
- If two global vargroups have the same key, the most recently created one will be used.

| --- | --- |
| **Project** | The specific application or workload within SleakOps. Determines the scope of the variable group. |
| **Service** | A microservice or component within the project. If selected, the vargroup is limited to it; otherwise, by selecting global it'll be accessible into the namespace. |
