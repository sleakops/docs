# Access Configuration

The Access Configuration allows you to extend your project's permissions by granting access to external dependencies from other projects and attaching additional IAM policies. This feature enables cross-project resource sharing and enhanced security configurations.

## Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to **Project** → **Settings**
2. Select **Access Configuration** from the settings menu
3. Configure external dependencies and extra policies as needed
4. Click **Apply changes** to save your configuration

## External Dependencies

### Dependencies Already Assigned

This section shows dependencies that have already been linked to your current project. These dependencies are available for your workloads to use and are marked with a blue checkbox to indicate they are active.

**Features:**
- View all currently assigned external dependencies
- See dependency type and project information
- Dependencies are automatically configured with appropriate permissions

### Available External Dependencies

This section displays dependencies from other projects that you can grant access to your current project. This enables cross-project resource sharing and collaboration.

**How it works:**
- Select dependencies from other projects that you wish to grant access to this project
- Only dependencies from projects you have access to will be displayed
- Once selected, the dependency becomes available in the "Dependencies Already Assigned" section

## Extra Policies

The Extra Policies section allows you to attach additional IAM policies to your project, providing enhanced permissions beyond the default project access.

### Adding Extra Policies

1. Click the **"Attach more policies"** button
2. Select from available IAM policies in your AWS account
3. Review the policy permissions before attaching
4. The policies will be applied to grant additional permissions to the project

### Policy Management

- **Custom Policies**: Attach policies you've created in your AWS IAM console
- **AWS Managed Policies**: Use pre-configured AWS policies for common use cases
- **Policy Review**: All attached policies are listed and can be reviewed
- **Removal**: Policies can be detached if no longer needed

:::tip Cross-Project Access
External dependencies enable teams to share resources across different projects, improving collaboration and resource utilization.

:::warning Security Considerations
- Review all attached policies to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly audit external dependencies to ensure they're still needed
- Monitor access patterns to identify any unusual activity
