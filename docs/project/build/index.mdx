# Build

We have repeteadly talked about Build in both [Project documentation ](/project/index.mdx) and [Initial Build documentation](/project/index.mdx). It's easy to understand a Build in the context o [Docker <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.docker.com/) because it is an image of Docker that can be used to compile and assemble source code, dependencies and libraries. 

### Build creation

To create a Build you only need four parameters, only the Project field is required as the other three are, if not set, chosen by default:
- Project: Refers to what we call ProjectEnv, here you choose which ProjectEnv you want to build.
- Branch: Lets you choose any branch of the repository that you've chosen as Project. Defaults to Environment name.
- Commit hash: You can also choose the commit has to build a specific commit and not the last one as we do by default. Defaults to last commit.
- Tag: Just a tag to differentiate builds. Defaults to 'latest'

## Why do we need to Build a Docker image?

First of all, this 'images' is what is used to deploy all the services inside Kubernetes as Docker containers through [Helm charts <FiExternalLink/>](https://helm.sh/docs/). Sleakops uses [Kaniko <FiExternalLink/>](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) tool image, which is a tool to create container images from a Dockerfile, inside a Kubernetes cluster. This tool requires access to your repository as it builds the images using the files of the commit that you have provided. 

:::info

Remember that you need a Build to update the code that the Deployment runs inside the Kubernetes Cluster.

SleakOps has its own CLI Tool that you can use to automate Builds and Deployments in your CI/CD. More info [here](/cli.mdx).
