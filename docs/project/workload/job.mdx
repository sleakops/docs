# Job


**Jobs** are single-run tasks, typically used for one-off operations like updates, system checks, or maintenance. They run once and then complete, and you can check their progress or results by viewing the corresponding pod’s logs.


## FAQs

### How can I configure memory and CPU settings for my Job?
</summary>
You can configure the *CPU Min* and *CPU Max* values to set the minimum and maximum CPU resources each instance in your cluster can use. Similarly, you set **Memory Min** and **Memory Max** for memory allocation per instance.

## **Lets add a Job for your Project**
### 1. Navigate to create Job section
Into the _Left Pane_, access _Workloads_. Then select the _Job_ tab  and then, at the top right corner, click on the _Create_ button.

    src="/img/workloads/job/list.png"
    alt="job-list"
/>
</Zoom>

### 2. Select a Project and a Name for the job
Start with the basic information, complete these attributes and click Next to continue.

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Identify your job. |
| **Project** | Select between the existent projects.  |
| **Command** | The command that runs the job. |
| **Image** | By default the job usage the image of your project, but you can override that with another |

### 3. Finish the set up
This step outlines the key attributes for configuring the resources of a Job in SleakOps, allowing for flexible management of CPU, memory, and scaling behaviors.

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **CPU Min** | The minimum amount of CPU resources allocated for each instance in the cluster. This ensures that each instance always has this amount of CPU available. |
| **CPU Max** | The maximum CPU resources that each instance in the cluster can use. This cap helps prevent any single instance from consuming too much CPU.  |
| **Memory Min** | The minimum amount of memory allocated for each instance in the cluster. This guarantees that the instance has enough memory to operate efficiently.  |
| **Memory Max** | The maximum amount of memory each instance in the cluster can utilize. It limits the memory usage to prevent any single instance from overconsuming resources.  |
