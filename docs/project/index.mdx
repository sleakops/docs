# Project

In Sleakops a project represents a codebase and it is managed by a git repository. Once a [provider](provider/index.mdx) has been created, you can create projects for your company. Create as many projects as repositories your application has.

Projects are related to several other Sleakops entities like environments and services. The union of a project with an environment makes a namespace for the cluster. Services depend on projects to produce containerized images from a Dockerfile.

## Create projects

To create a project you need to give Sleakops authorization to access repositories from an external git provider account where the sources of your project are hosted.
Sleakops integrates these third-party git applications:

- Github
- GitLab. If your GitLab is self-hosted, please follow these [instructions](project/gitlab.mdx).
- Bitbucket

### Cloud resources

When working with AWS, every time you add a project you get a new empty [ECR <FiExternalLink/>](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repository, hosted in the management account,
according to our [proposed architecture](/docs/provider/aws.mdx).
