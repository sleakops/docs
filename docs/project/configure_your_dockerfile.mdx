# Configure your Dockerfile

Configuring your Dockerfile is crucial because it dictates how your application is built and packaged into a container. A properly configured Dockerfile ensures that your Docker image contains all necessary dependencies and settings, allowing your application to run smoothly in your environment.

**What do I need to specify when configuring the Dockerfile in SleakOps?**
</summary>
When configuring your Dockerfile in SleakOps, you need to:
  1. **Set the Dockerfile Path**: Provide the relative path of the Dockerfile within your repository.
  2. **Provide Docker Arguments**: If your Dockerfile requires specific build arguments (e.g., environment variables, configurations), you must provide these values during the Docker image build process.
</details>

<summary>
**How do I add the Dockerfile arguments?**
</summary>
Once you specify the Dockerfile path, SleakOps analyzes it to identify any build arguments that are required. If necessary, SleakOps will prompt you to provide values for these arguments. You can update these arguments at any time through the SleakOps interface.

<summary>
**What are Docker build arguments?**
</summary>
Docker build arguments are variables that are passed during the Docker build process to customize the build according to different environments or configurations. They are defined in the Dockerfile using the `ARG` keyword. SleakOps will identify these arguments and ask you to provide the required values. You can also update these arguments later if needed.

You can add the by following the steps below.

## Set up your Dockerfile
### 1. Access to your project settings
  1. **Complete the Dockerfile Path:** To enable SleakOps to search for the needed arguments, specify the Dockerfile Path and save the changes. SleakOps will then analyze your Dockerfile and render the required build arguments for you to provide.

| **Dockerfile Path** | The Dockerfile is a critical component used to build your project into a container. The Dockerfile Path field requires the relative file path to your Dockerfile within the repository (e.g., /Dockerfile, /src/Dockerfile, or /app/Dockerfile). This file contains the instructions needed to create the container image, which SleakOps will build and later use for deployments. |

  2. **Add Arguments Before Saving:** If you already know the required arguments, you can enter them before saving. This allows you to provide necessary values upfront rather than waiting for SleakOps to analyze the Dockerfile.

  :::tip
    If you choose to add the argument using the text option: Each argument should be added on a new line, separated by an equal sign (`=`), with no extra spaces. 

    ARGUMENT_NAME = VALUE  
    ARGUMENT_TWO = VALUE  
    ARGUMENT_ONE = VALUE
