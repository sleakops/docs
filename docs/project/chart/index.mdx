# Chart

A **Chart** is a key piece in a Project as it is used to define what SleakOps deploys when a Deployment is run. A Chart is the analog that SleakOps uses of a [Helm Chart <FiExternalLink/>](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) and implements it for its own functionalities.

## Where can I found the Chart section?
The Chart section is located in Project -> Settings
<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/chart/settings-chart.png"
    alt="settings-chart"
/>
</Zoom>

:::warning
As SleakOps uses NodePools to determine in which Nodes are the resources deployed, you can only deploy resources by setting up the 'tolerations' parameter that targets an existing NodePool.

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/chart/config-chart.png"
    alt="config-chart"
/>
</Zoom>


## Default Values used by SleakOps
SleakOps deploys his own Charts and applied some values to them, you can found them here:
<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/chart/default-values-place.png"
    alt="default-values-place"
/>
</Zoom>

And in the right side, a drawer will open where you will find the default values used by SleakOps for of all the Workloads of the Project.
For example for the 'api' WebService created in this Project:

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/chart/api-web-service-default-values.png"
    alt="config-chart"
/>
</Zoom>

And as global values we have:
<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/chart/global-default-values.png"
    alt="config-chart"
/>
</Zoom>

### Can I modify the Chart deployed by a Project?
</summary>
Yes, but partially. You can add new templates that you might need by using the [***Extra Templates***](./extra_templates.mdx). You can also add dependencies to the Chart by using the [***Chart Dependencies***](./chart_dependencies.mdx) feature, it is analog to [Helm Chart Dependencies <FiExternalLink/>](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency/).
