# Chart Dependencies

Chart Dependencies allow you to add external charts to your project, following the same pattern as [Helm Chart Dependencies <FiExternalLink/>](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency/). This feature enables you to integrate third-party services and components seamlessly into your SleakOps deployment.

:::warning NodePool Configuration Required
Since SleakOps uses NodePools to determine resource placement, you must configure the `tolerations` parameter to target an existing NodePool for all dependency resources.
:::

## Supported Chart Repositories

Currently, SleakOps supports **Bitnami Charts** exclusively. You can browse available charts on [ArtifactHub <FiExternalLink/>](https://artifacthub.io/) to find suitable dependencies for your project.

## Adding Chart Dependencies

To add a new Chart Dependency, click the **Create** button in the Chart Configuration section:

    alt="Chart dependencies create button"
/>
</Zoom>

### Configuration Steps

1. **Search and Select**: Use the first two fields to search for the chart name and select your desired version
2. **Configure Values**: Modify the values section below to customize the deployment
3. **Set Tolerations**: **Critical** - Update all `tolerations` fields in the chart values to target your NodePool

/>
</Zoom>

:::tip Important
Ensure every `tolerations` field in the chart values is properly configured to use a NodePool. Without this configuration, Kubernetes cannot determine where to schedule the pods, leading to deployment failures.

### My deployment succeeded but pods aren't working. What's wrong?
</summary>
The most common cause is incorrect NodePool configuration. Verify that:
- All `tolerations` fields are properly set to target existing NodePools
- The NodePool has sufficient resources
- The NodePool is in a healthy state
