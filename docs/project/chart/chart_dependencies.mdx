# Chart Dependencies
Allows you to add Dependencies to your charts just as it is naturally done in Helm.
This feature allows you to add [Helm Chart Dependencies <FiExternalLink/>](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency/), as it is naturally done using Helm.

:::warning
As SleakOps uses NodePools to determine in which Nodes are the resources deployed, you can only deploy resources by setting up the 'tolerations' parameter that targets an existing NodePool. 
:::

At this moment, we only allow Bitnami Charts. In addition, we recommend you to check Charts in [ArtifactHub <FiExternalLink/>](https://artifacthub.io/)

To add a new ChartDependency you can do so with the 'Create' buttom at the right side of the Chart Configuration:
<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/chart/chart-dependencies-create.png"
    alt="config-chart"
/>
</Zoom>

There you can search the Chart name and select the version you want to deploy in the first two fields.
Below you can modify the values that you will use to deploy it.
IMPORTANT: Modify every 'toleration' field found in the values of the chart to use a NodePool. This is crucial as if not set, Kubernetes will not know where to allocate the Pods.
<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">

    src="/img/project/chart/chart-dependencies-form.png"
    alt="config-chart"
/>
</Zoom>

### All was properly deployed but my Pods are not working, what could be causing this?

The main reason for this problem is associated with the wrong definition of the NodePools. Check that first and follow the recommendations.
