# Cronjobs


**CronJobs** are scheduled tasks that run at regular intervals (e.g., daily at 3 a.m., weekly, or monthly). They automate repetitive tasks such as backups, log cleanup, or periodic updates. Like Jobs, they also run in pods, which makes it easy to view their logs.


## FAQs 

<details>
<summary>
### How can I configure memory and CPU settings for my Cronjob?
</summary>
You can configure the *CPU Min* and *CPU Max* values to set the minimum and maximum CPU resources each instance in your cluster can use. Similarly, you set **Memory Min** and **Memory Max** for memory allocation per instance.
</details>




## **Lets add a Cronjob for your Project**
### 1. Navigate to create Cronjob section
Into the _Left Pane_, access _Executions_. Then select the _Cronjob_ tab  and then, at the top right corner, click on the _Create_ button.

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/executions/cronjob/list.png"
    alt="cronjob-list"
/>
</Zoom>

### 2. Select a Project and a Name for the cronjob
Start with the basic information, complete these attributes and click Next to continue.

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Identify your cronjob. |
| **Project** | Select between the existent projects.  |
| **Command** | The command that runs the cronjob. |

Once those attributes are completed, click the _Next_ button to move forward. 

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/executions/cronjob/create-1.png"
    alt="cronjob-create-1"
/>
</Zoom>

### 3. Define the periodicity
Select how will be your connection and click on _Next_. 

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Crontab** | Cron expresion to determine the schedule to execute the cronjob  |

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/executions/cronjob/create-2.png"
    alt="cronjob-create-2"
/>
</Zoom>

### 5. Finish the set up
This step outlines the key attributes for configuring the resources of a Cronjob in SleakOps, allowing for flexible management of CPU, memory, and scaling behaviors.

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **CPU Min** | The minimum amount of CPU resources allocated for each instance in the cluster. This ensures that each instance always has this amount of CPU available. |
| **CPU Max** | The maximum CPU resources that each instance in the cluster can use. This cap helps prevent any single instance from consuming too much CPU.  |
| **Memory Min** | The minimum amount of memory allocated for each instance in the cluster. This guarantees that the instance has enough memory to operate efficiently.  |
| **Memory Max** | The maximum amount of memory each instance in the cluster can utilize. It limits the memory usage to prevent any single instance from overconsuming resources.  |
