# Hooks


**Hooks** are tasks triggered by specific events during a deployment. For example, you can use Hooks to automatically run a database migration or collect statistics whenever a new version of your application is deployed. These tasks also run in pods, making it straightforward to troubleshoot by examining the logs.

## FAQs 


<details>
<summary>
### How can I configure memory and CPU settings for my Hook?
</summary>
You can configure the *CPU Min* and *CPU Max* values to set the minimum and maximum CPU resources each instance in your cluster can use. Similarly, you set **Memory Min** and **Memory Max** for memory allocation per instance.
</details>


## **Lets add a Hook for your Project**
### 1. Navigate to create Hook section
Into the _Left Pane_, access _Executions_. Then select the _Hook_ tab  and then, at the top right corner, click on the _Create_ button.

<img
    src="/img/executions/hook/list.png"
    alt="hook-list"
/>
</Zoom>

### 2. Select a Project and a Name for the hook
Start with the basic information, complete these attributes and click Next to continue.

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Identify your web service. |
| **Project** | Select between the existent projects.  |
| **Command** | The command that runs the service. |

Once those attributes are completed, click the _Next_ button to move forward.

<img
    src="/img/executions/hook/create-1.png"
    alt="hook-create-1"
/>
</Zoom>

### 3. Define the deploy event
Select how will be your connection and click on _Next_. 

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Event** | Define when execute the hook. [Check available events](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/#the-available-hooks)  |

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/executions/hook/create-2.png"
    alt="hook-create-2"
/>
</Zoom>

### 5. Finish the set up
This step outlines the key attributes for configuring the resources of a Hook in SleakOps, allowing for flexible management of CPU, memory, and scaling behaviors.

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **CPU Min** | The minimum amount of CPU resources allocated for each instance in the cluster. This ensures that each instance always has this amount of CPU available. |
| **CPU Max** | The maximum CPU resources that each instance in the cluster can use. This cap helps prevent any single instance from consuming too much CPU.  |
| **Memory Min** | The minimum amount of memory allocated for each instance in the cluster. This guarantees that the instance has enough memory to operate efficiently.  |
| **Memory Max** | The maximum amount of memory each instance in the cluster can utilize. It limits the memory usage to prevent any single instance from overconsuming resources.  |
