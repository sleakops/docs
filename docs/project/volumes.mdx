# Volumes

In the context of Sleakops, volumes refer to AWS/Kubernetes storage resources attached to a cluster. They serve as general storage for specified containers. Pods can only interact with these volumes if they are explicitly attached to them.
You can define the volumes in the [Project](/project) form:
<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/project/PROJECT-volumes-form.png" alt="PROJECT-volumes-form" style={{ height: '250px', width: 'auto' }}/>
</Zoom>
Whenever a volume is needed, Sleakops deploys an EFS CSI Driver within the [cluster](/cluster). This allows every Project to have its own unique volume mount, storing folders based on the paths you specify.
A practical use-case for Volumes is when you want all your pods to access the same files, such as a shared folder that requires its content to be persistent.

For more details on how EFS is used for volumes, refer to the [EFS documentation](/cluster/addons/efs).
