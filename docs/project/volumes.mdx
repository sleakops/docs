# Volumes

In the context of Sleakops, volumes refer to AWS/Kubernetes storage resources attached to a cluster. They serve as general storage for specified containers. Pods can only interact with these volumes if they are explicitly attached to them.
You can define the volumes in the [Project](/project) form:
<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
  <img src="/img/project/PROJECT-volumes-form.png" alt="PROJECT-volumes-form" style={{ height: '250px', width: 'auto' }}/>
</Zoom>
Whenever a volume is needed, Sleakops deploys an EFS CSI Driver within the [cluster](/cluster). This allows every Project to have its own unique volume mount, storing folders based on the paths you specify.
A practical use-case for Volumes is when you want all your pods to access the same files, such as a shared folder that requires its content to be persistent.

For more details on how EFS is used for volumes, refer to the [EFS documentation](/cluster/addons/efs).

## Creating Volumes

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/create-new-volume.png"
    alt="new volume modal"
/>
</Zoom>

To create a new volume for your project:

1. **Click on "Create Volumes"** in the Project settings
2. **Add the mount path** - Specify the directory path where the volume will be mounted in your containers
3. **Set storage capacity** - Define the amount of storage space allocated to the volume
4. **Choose retention policy** - Select between:
   - **Delete**: Volume will be removed when deleted from SleakOps
   - **Retain**: Volume will persist in AWS even if removed from SleakOps

:::tip Volume Configuration
- Mount paths should be absolute paths (e.g., `/app/data`, `/var/logs`)
- Storage capacity is specified in GB
- The retain policy determines data persistence when volumes are removed

## Deleting Volumes

<Zoom overlayBgColorEnd="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)">
<img
    src="/img/project/delete-volume.png"
    alt="delete volume click"
/>
</Zoom>

To remove a volume from your project:

1. **Click the "X" button** next to the volume you want to delete
2. **Confirm the deletion** when prompted

:::warning Data Loss Warning
Deleting a volume will permanently remove all data stored in it. Make sure to backup any important data before deletion.
:::

:::info Retain Policy Behavior
- **Delete Policy**: Volume and all data are permanently removed from AWS
- **Retain Policy**: Volume remains in AWS but is detached from the project, preserving your data
