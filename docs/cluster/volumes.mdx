# Volumes

As a general definition for our case, volumes are a AWS/Kubernetes storage resource attached to the cluster used as a general storage for the desired containers. The pods will be able to interact with these volumes only if these volumes are explicitly attached to them.

The volumes that you set are defined in the [Project ](/project) form:

  <img src="/img/project/PROJECT-volumes-form.png" alt="PROJECT-volumes-form" style={{ height: '125px', width: 'auto' }}/>
</Zoom>

When some volume is required, Sleakops creates an EFS CSI Driver inside the [cluster](/cluster) that every Project can use to have its own volume mount where it stores the folders based on the paths you've set.

An example of Volumes usage is when you need that all your pods use the same files, like a shared folder that you need its content to be persistent.
