# Getting Started with Clusters

## How Do I Begin?

The first time you log into Sleakops after creating your user, you are met with this screen, where the first thing to note is that you need to have a [Management](/provider/aws-provider#management-account) account in which we will deploy the necessary roles via [Cloud Formation](/provider/aws-provider#aws-cloud-formation) to interact with your application. If you want to know how this process works, you can visit the following link to our documentation [Provider Creation](/provider/aws-provider#provider-creation)

Once the Cloud Formation process is completed, you can proceed with the form, where the following information will be requested:

- **Name**: Identification field, it is recommended to use a name that is representative of the selected cloud provider (for now, we only support AWS).
- **AWS Account ID**: Here you must enter your **AWS Root Account** and take the 12-digit number that represents the [Account ID](/provider/aws-provider#aws-account-id). A small snippet is provided next to the field that, once inside the account, allows you to find the Account ID. If the snippet does not work, you can access your Root account's billing and get the ID [AWS Billing <FiExternalLink/>](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account).
