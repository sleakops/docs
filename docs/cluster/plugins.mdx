# Essential Add-ons for a High-Functioning EKS Cluster

At SleakOps, our mission is to ensure your EKS cluster runs smoothly and efficiently. 
To achieve this, we install essential components that handle critical functionalities in your cluster. 
These components play a vital role in monitoring, external connectivity, load balancing, and intelligent node provisioning, empowering your applications to thrive.

- **Metric Server**:
SleakOps installs the Metric Server, a crucial component that collects and provides valuable cluster and node-level metrics. It enables you to monitor the performance of your cluster, understand resource utilization, and make informed scaling decisions. With the Metric Server in place, you gain valuable insights into your cluster's health, empowering you to optimize its performance effortlessly.

- **External-DNS**:
Simplifying DNS management is essential, and SleakOps ensures seamless external connectivity by deploying External-DNS. 
This component automatically creates or updates DNS records in your DNS provider, ensuring your applications are accessible via user-friendly domain names. Say goodbye to manual DNS management and let External-DNS handle it for you.
More information about it can be found [here <FiExternalLink/>](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server).

- **Automatic Load Balancer**:
SleakOps takes the hassle out of load balancer provisioning with the Automatic Load Balancer component. We ensure automatic provisioning of load balancers for your services in the cluster. 
This dynamic configuration distributes incoming traffic across your application instances efficiently, maintaining high availability and scaling as needed.
More information about it can be found [here <FiExternalLink/>](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/).

- **Karpenter Deployment**:
As a pioneer in intelligent node provisioning, SleakOps expertly deploys Karpenter. This critical component scales your cluster efficiently based on actual resource demands. 
With Karpenter, nodes are automatically provisioned and deprovisioned as workload requirements change, minimizing resource waste and maximizing performance.
For more information about how karpenter works, check their [documentation <FiExternalLink/>](https://karpenter.sh/docs/)

By partnering with SleakOps, your EKS cluster becomes a robust and resilient tool, capable of meeting the demands of modern containerized applications while maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. 
Leave the technical intricacies to us, and focus on what matters mostâ€”building and delivering exceptional applications.
