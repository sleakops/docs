# Creating a Node Pool

### 1. Access your cluster's settings to access the Node Pools section

From the Cluster Listing, select one and access the Setting option. Then, click on the Node Pools box.

  />
</Zoom>

### 2. Click on Create

Into the Node Pool section, if you have permission, you'll find the *Create* option at the top right corner. Click on it. 

Notice, that the quantity of Node Pools per Cluster might be limited by your plan.

</Zoom>

### 3. Set up you node pool

In the create Node Pool modal enter:

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Enter the name of your choice for your node pool. It cannot be repeated within a cluster.  |
| **Instance Type** | Select between Spot and On Demand based on your needs. See [**What are the different kind of node pools?**](/cluster/nodepools)  |
| **Architecture Type** | Select the architecture type to be used during the creation for your instances: (64-Bit) ARM or (64-Bit) X86, based on your performance and compatibility needs. Then you’ll be able of creating new instances using a different architecture.  |
| **Max Memory**  | This sets the maximum memory the cluster can use as services scale. The autoscaler provisions instances based on demand, but this doesn't mean the cluster always uses the maximum memory; it just defines the upper limit for the autoscaler. |
| **Max CPU** | This sets the maximum CPU the cluster can use as services scale. The autoscaler provisions instances based on demand, but this doesn't mean the cluster always uses the maximum CPU; it just defines the upper limit for the autoscaler. |
| Storage | Set by default in 20GB, you can modify it based on your need.  |

Once you’ve completed the form, click on *Create* in order to trigger the node pool creation into the selected cluster.
