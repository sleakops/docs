# Grafana

Introduction
In Sleakops [Grafana <FiExternalLink/>](https://grafana.com/docs/) is an addon that enables you to view metrics about your cluster's performance and health. Grafana is installed alongside [Prometheus <FiExternalLink/>](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) to help you track metrics such as CPU and memory usage, as well as other key indicators that help you monitor the state of your infrastructure in real time.
Also Grafana is needed to use other addons like Loki and OTEL.

### How it works
</summary>
Grafana as a monitoring tool, let's you directly connect to datasources within your cluster without extensive configuration. When installing Grafana, Sleakops configures Prometheus datasource, providing quick access to essential metrics through a centralized interface.
When installing Loki or Otel, those datasources are also connected.

### Provisioned Dashboards
</summary>
Grafana on Sleakops comes with a series of practical dashboards. They cover general system metrics, offering organized views to monitor various aspects of application performance and resource usage. These dashboards can be used out-of-the-box, offering consistent data visualizations that simplify ongoing system monitoring and management.
Sleakops ships with these dashboards, to monitor Resource allocations:
- Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster
- Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespaces (Pods)
- Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespaces (Workloads)
- Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Nodes (Pods)

These ones for networking:
- Kubernetes / Networking / Cluster
- Kubernetes / Networking / Namespaces (Pods)
- Kubernetes / Networking / Namespaces (Workloads)
And some others like CoreDNS which monitors this internal dns and service discovery system.

All of them are useful to monitor the health of your cluster and the applications running on it.
Specially to resize executions, investigate if more replicas are needed or if the resources are well allocated.
Dashboards are customizable, allowing you to adjust the layout and data displayed to suit your specific monitoring needs. Also you can create your own dashboards.

### Viewing Deployment Resources
</summary>
To observe the resources used by a deployment, navigate to the resource monitoring dashboard in Grafana. 
Once logged in, go to:

 Home -> Dashboards -> Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Pods)

This dashboard is set up to display real-time data on CPU, memory, and disk usage, allowing you to track and manage the resources allocated to each deployment within your cluster.
