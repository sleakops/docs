# Grafana

Introduction
In Sleakops [Grafana <FiExternalLink/>](https://grafana.com/docs/) is an addon that enables you to view metrics about your cluster's performance and health. Grafana is installed alongside [Prometheus <FiExternalLink/>](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) to help you track metrics such as CPU and memory usage, as well as other key indicators that help you monitor the state of your infrastructure in real time.
Also Grafana is needed to use other addons like Loki and OTEL.

 **How it works**
</summary>
Grafana as a monitoring tool, let's you directly connect to datasources within your cluster without extensive configuration. When installing Grafana, Sleakops configures Prometheus datasource, providing quick access to essential metrics through a centralized interface.
When installing Loki or Otel, those datasources are also connected.
