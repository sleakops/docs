  **How is EBS used in SleakOps?**
</summary>
In SleakOps, EBS is used to deliver persistent storage for applications running on EC2 instances. Each EBS volume can be attached to a single EC2 instance at a time, although multiple volumes can be attached to one instance. Within Kubernetes, EBS is used for persistent volumes, ensuring data consistency across pod restarts and rescheduling. SleakOps manages and configures EBS automatically to suit your application needs.
