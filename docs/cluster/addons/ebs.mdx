# EBS (Elastic Block Store)

In SleakOps, AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) is used for persistent block storage for EC2 instances. EBS volumes are particularly useful for applications that require low-latency access to data and high performance.

## What is EBS?

[AWS EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) is a block storage service from AWS designed to provide persistent storage for EC2 instances. EBS volumes are automatically replicated within their Availability Zone to protect against hardware failures, offering high availability and durability.

## Using EBS in SleakOps

In the context of SleakOps, EBS is used to provide persistent storage for applications running on EC2 instances. Each EBS volume can be attached to one EC2 instance at a time, but multiple volumes can be attached to a single instance.

EBS is used for persistent volumes within Kubernetes, ensuring that data remains available and consistent across pod restarts and rescheduling. Currently, the use of EBS is internal to SleakOps, meaning it is managed and configured automatically by the platform to meet the needs of your applications.
