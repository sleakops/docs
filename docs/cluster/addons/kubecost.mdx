# Kubecost: Cluster Cost Monitoring

Introduction
[Kubecost <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.kubecost.com/) is an essential cost management tool integrated with SleakOps that provides detailed visibility into your Kubernetes cluster costs. It helps you understand your cluster spending by breaking down expenses across namespaces, deployments, and individual workloads.

The best way to read the information that Kubecost has is through its frontend that you can access from the Cluster detail.

Kubecost landing dashboard shows the costs distributed by Time and Namespace.

## FAQs 

<details>
<summary>
### What does the __idle__ metric means?
</summary>
The '__idle__' shown in all Kubecost metrics is a value that shows how much of the capacity of all your filtered options is not being used. Be careful, this value should be prudently analyzed as many of this "idle" capacity will be part of a Node that is not yet fully allocated or should be available for your workloads.

<summary>
### Should I be worried if my __idle__ value is too high?
</summary>
No, you could optimize this value by reducing the CPU and Memory requests of the [executions](/project/service) deployed in your Project, but bear in mind that many of this capacity is allocated as a maximum limit for your resource utilization even if it is not being used, this gives space for the internal scaling of each workload in case it needs it. By the other side, many of these workloads are cluster-critical so they will have an "idle" capacity to let them scale freely.

<summary>
### Could I review a Namespace more deeply?
</summary>
Kubecost has a good granularity of how much specific you could be when analyzing costs, for example, besides Namespace costs you can start digging and by clicking the Namespace you can analyze the costs of the pods, deployments and others it has allocated on it.

<summary>
### Can I analyze something else beside namespaces?
</summary>
Yes, from the main dashboard you can analyze more specifically the costs of a specific Node as an entity. It also allows you to review the Storage costs that is being used. For example, for a specific node you could see this:

### Does Kubecost has any feature to analyze Networking costs?
</summary>
At this moment SleakOps is making available the capacity to allow 'NetworkCosts' which is a feature of Kubecost that estimates the cost of the network traffic that each workload has. This feature is a really good choice if you want to analyze cluster network traffic more deeply. It can be allowed in the Kubecost form:
