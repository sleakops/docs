# SQS-AWS

*SQS* is a message queuing service disposed by AWS, it's idea is to be used to diminish the complexity and necessity to manage and operate this kind of message service and delegate a big part of this tasks to AWS. *SQS* as a queuing service admits us to send, store and receive messages, it's main funcionality is to order them on a robust queue to not lose any and also to allow us to send different requests to software components without having to wait for the specific service to be available.

You can find much more information of *SQS* on it's [developer guide <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html).
