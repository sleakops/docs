# AWS Elasticache Redis

For caching solutions, Sleakoks supports as a [dependency](./index.mdx) ElastiCache for Redis. You can read more about its benefits in
this [link <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/WhatIs.html).
We offer AWS single-node Redis instance running **Redis engine 6.2**.

When you create this dependency, you only need
to provide the parameters listed below:

| Name     | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NodeType | The node type to use                                                 |
| Port     | If you don't use the default port **6379**, the used port goes here. |

If you are unsure about which node type to choose, this [doc <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/nodes-select-size.html#CacheNodes.SelectSize)
might help you.

The subnet group needed will be within your environment VPC according to our [proposed architecture](/docs/provider/aws.mdx).

Additional parameters are the default for this resource, in AWS default.redis6.x.
