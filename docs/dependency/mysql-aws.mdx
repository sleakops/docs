# AWS MySQL RDS

For database solutions, Sleakops supports as a [dependency](./index.mdx) AWS-managed MySQL RDS, with the benefits of cloud-managed relational database services like scalability, backups and software patchings.
You can read more about those benefits in this [link <FiExternalLink/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Concepts.RDS).
