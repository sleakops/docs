<details>
<summary>
**Can I modify dependency configurations after initial setup?**
</summary>
Yes, you can update dependency configurations at any time. Make sure to save any changes in the SleakOps interface to apply the updates.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
**Can the same dependency be used for multiple Projects?**
</summary>
At the moment this is not possible, you need one dependency per each project.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
**How do I delete a Dependency?**
</summary>
By accessing the *Dependency Listing* and clicking the delete option.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
**What happens when I delete a dependency?**
</summary>
By deleting a dependency, SleakOps will remove all the information related to it and all what is related to it will stop working. To solve that SleakOps create a Deployment in PENDING_APPROVAL status, that must be run manually ASAP to stop the downtime. 
In case you delete a database, SleakOps will generate a final snapshot before its deletion.
