### Self-Hosted GitLab
</summary>

Connecting a self-hosted GitLab instance requires creating an OAuth application in your GitLab installation, as each self-hosted instance has a unique URL and authentication system.

#### Prerequisites

- Administrator access to your self-hosted GitLab instance
- Your GitLab instance must be accessible from the internet (SleakOps needs to communicate with it)
- HTTPS is strongly recommended for security

#### Step 1: Create an OAuth Application in Your GitLab Instance

1. **Access the Applications page**
   - Navigate to your GitLab instance: `https://yourgitlab.com/-/profile/applications`
   - Or go to: User Settings → Applications

2. **Create a new application**
   - Click "Add new application" or "New application"
   - Fill in the following information:

| **Field** | **Value** |
|-----------|----------|
| **Name** | SleakOps (or any descriptive name) |
| **Redirect URI** | https://api.sleakops.com/api/integrations/self-gitlab/callback/ |
| **Scopes** | Select `api` and `offline_access` (required for persistent access and automatic token renewal) |

:::warning
The Redirect URI must be **exactly** as shown below (including the trailing slash):
```
https://api.sleakops.com/api/integrations/self-gitlab/callback/
```
Do not modify this URL.
:::

3. **Save the application**
   - Click "Save application" or "Submit"
   - You will be shown two important values:
     - **Application ID** (Client ID)
     - **Secret** (Client Secret)

:::caution
Copy both the Application ID and Secret immediately. The Secret will only be shown once and cannot be retrieved later.
:::

:::tip
Store these credentials securely. If you lose the Secret, you'll need to regenerate the OAuth application.
:::

#### Step 2: Connect Your Self-Hosted GitLab to SleakOps

1. **Navigate to SleakOps Authorizations**
   - Log in to your [SleakOps account](https://console.sleakops.com/settings/authorizations/)
   - Go to Settings → Authorizations

2. **Select Self-Hosted GitLab**
   - Click on "Self-Hosted GitLab" integration option

3. **Enter your OAuth application details**
   - **GitLab Instance URL**: Enter your GitLab instance URL (e.g., `https://gitlab.yourcompany.com`)
     - Do not include a trailing slash
     - Must start with `http://` or `https://`
   - **Application ID**: Paste the Application ID from Step 1
   - **Application Secret**: Paste the Secret from Step 1

4. **Authorize SleakOps**
   - Click "Connect" or "Authorize"
   - You will be redirected to your GitLab instance
   - Review the permissions and click "Authorize"
   - You will be redirected back to SleakOps

5. **Verify the connection**
   - Once redirected, you should see your self-hosted GitLab account listed as connected
   - You can now select repositories from your self-hosted GitLab instance when creating projects

#### What permissions does SleakOps need?

SleakOps requires two scopes:

**`api` scope** grants the following permissions:
- Read repository information and file contents
- Create and manage branches
- Create and update files (for automated deployments)
- Create merge requests
- Access commit information

**`offline_access` scope** allows SleakOps to:
- Obtain a refresh token for long-term access
- Automatically renew expired access tokens
- Maintain persistent connection without requiring re-authorization

:::warning
Without `offline_access`, the access token will expire after ~2 hours and the integration will break until manually re-authorized.
:::

These permissions are required for SleakOps to clone your repositories, build container images, deploy applications, and manage infrastructure-as-code.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Connection fails with "Invalid URL" error
- Ensure your GitLab instance URL does not end with a trailing slash
- Verify the URL starts with `http://` or `https://`
- Example: ✅ `https://gitlab.company.com` ❌ `https://gitlab.company.com/`

##### Authorization redirects but connection fails
- Verify the Redirect URI in your GitLab OAuth application matches exactly: `https://api.sleakops.com/api/integrations/self-gitlab/callback/`
- Check that the Application ID and Secret are correct
- Ensure both `api` and `offline_access` scopes were selected when creating the OAuth application

##### Network/Firewall issues
- Ensure your self-hosted GitLab instance is accessible from SleakOps servers
- If your GitLab is behind a firewall, you may need to whitelist SleakOps IP addresses
- Contact SleakOps support for IP whitelist information

##### SSL/Certificate errors
- Self-signed certificates may cause connection issues
- Use a valid SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority
- Ensure your GitLab instance has proper HTTPS configuration
