# Release

## What is a Release

In Sleakops a release represents a deployable state of all the services (web-services, workers, cronjobs, jobs) of a [project](/docs/project) in a [environment](/docs/environment)

## Release Creation

To create a release you must have one or more services with unreleased changes ('draft' state), a [environment](/docs/environment) and a version number to set to the release
after that you are ready to [deploy](/docs/deployment) this release on selected [cluster](/docs/cluster).

## How SleakOps handle release

When a release is created a Helm chart is built and pushed to a chart repository created (if it does not exists) at this point.
This chart contains all your SleakOps services and depending on the type of these services, the chart, will contain different resources.

## Helm chart resources

### SleakOps web-service service:

a Kubernetes deployment
a Kubernetes service
a Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

Ingress generates his hosts using <service_name>.<environment_name>.<organization_name>\.<yourdomain\.com>

### SleakOps worker service:

a Kubernetes deployment
a Kubernetes HPA

### SleakOps hook service:

a Kubernetes job

This job uses Kubernetes hooks to start
