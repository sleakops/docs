## What is a Release

In Sleakops a release represents a deployable state of all the services (web-services, workers, cronjobs, jobs) of a [project](/docs/project) in a [environment](/docs/environment)

## Release creation

To create a release you must have one or more services with unreleased changes ('draft' state), a [environment](/docs/environment) and a version number to set to the release
after that you are ready to [deploy](/docs/deployment) this realease on selected [cluster](/docs/cluster).

## How SleakOps handle release

When a release is created a Helm chart is created and pushed to a chart repository created (if not exists) in this point.
This chart contanis all your SleakOps services and depends of the type of these services, the chart, will contain different resources.
