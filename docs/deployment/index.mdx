# Deployment

A Deployment in Sleakops means the introduction of a new version of your application. This involves three primary components, collectively representing a Helm Release:
- [Releases](/deployment/release.mdx): This is a versioned combination of your [Services](/service) such as WebServices, Workers, CronJobs, and Hooks.
- Build Image: Represented by a [Build](/project/build).
- Configuration Values: This includes resources like [Volumes](/cluster/volumes.mdx) and [VariableGroups](/vargroup).

:::info

Whenever there's an update to any of these resources, Sleakops will prompt you for a Deployment through the unpublished banner displayed [below](#unpublished-banner).

## Deploying your ProjectEnv

When a Deployment is created, we pull the image corresponding to the Build being deployed and before that we execute the Helm Release in the corresponding cluster namespace. The Helm release includes the required Kubernetes services, ingresses, workers, and other services that are also created.

There are multiple ways to generate a Deployment, these are summarized below. Be aware that we enforce some Deployments, more info will be found on [More on Deployment](/deployment/more_on_deployment.mdx#forced-deployments).

- [Service](/service/index.mdx): You will have a switcher to choose if you want to make a new Deployment or not.
- [VariableGroup](/vargroup): Functions similar to Services but does not create a new Release, it only update the [values ](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/) of the Deployment.
- [Dependency](/dependency): Automatically runs a Deployment. Read more about this case on [More on Deployment](/deployment/more_on_deployment.mdx).

### Manual Deployment

If you don't deploy your changes when you make them or if your change doesn't force a deployment, then you have three ways to execute a Deployment:

- [Build section](/project/build): From the Deploy button, you can select which Build you wish to deploy.

</Zoom>

<a id="unpublished-banner"></a>
- Unpublished Changes Banner: This banner appears when something is yet to be deployed on the cluster. Using this banner, you can opt to deploy only the VariableGroups and not the Services in 'draft' state.

- Using the [CLI ](/cli).
