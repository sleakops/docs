# Deployment

In Sleakops a deployment is the last step in getting your cloud infrastructure ready. Once all services are created a project can be deployed in a selected environment.
Remember that a project and environment make a namespace in a cluster. Sleakops will provide a Kubernetes deployment in the aforementioned cluster with all the services from the project.

## Create deployments

To create a deployment for a project in an environment you only need to provide a release name.

### Cloud resources

When you create a deployment in Sleakops, the related cluster will receive these entities:

- a Kubernetes deployment
- a Kubernetes service for every Sleakops service
- a Kubernetes Ingress for every Sleakops service
