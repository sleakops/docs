# Deployment

A Deployment in Sleakops signifies the installation of a new version of your application. This involves three primary components, together forming a Helm Release:
- [Releases](/deployment/release.mdx): These are versioned combinations of your [Services](/service) including WebServices, Workers, CronJobs, and Hooks.
- Build Image: Represented by a [Build](/project/build).
- Configuration Values: These comprise resources like [Volumes](/project/volumes.mdx) and [VariableGroups](/vargroup).

:::info

When there's an update to any of these resources, Sleakops will notify you about a Deployment via the unpublished banner shown [below](#unpublished-banner).

## Deploying your ProjectEnv

Upon creating a Deployment, we fetch the image corresponding to the Build to be deployed. Before this, we execute the Helm Release in the appropriate cluster namespace. This Helm release includes necessary Kubernetes services, ingresses, workers, and other services.

Various methods exist to generate a Deployment. These are outlined below. Note that we force certain Deployments. For details, refer to [More on Deployment](/deployment/more_on_deployment.mdx#forced-deployments).

- [Service](/service/index.mdx): Provides a switcher allowing you to decide whether to run a new Deployment.
- [VariableGroup](/vargroup): Operates similarly to Services but doesn't create a new Release. Instead, it only updates the [values](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/) of the Deployment.
- [Dependency](/dependency): Triggers a Deployment automatically. Delve deeper into this at [More on Deployment](/deployment/more_on_deployment.mdx).

### Manual Deployment

If you skip deploying your changes immediately, or if your modification doesn't enforces a deployment, you have three methods to execute a Deployment:

- [Build section](/project/build): Utilizing the Deploy button, you can determine which Build to deploy.

</Zoom>

- Unpublished Changes Banner: This banner is shown when there's content pending that was not yet deployed on the cluster. Through this banner, you have the choice to deploy only the VariableGroups or if you want to deploy everything, including the Services in the 'draft' state.

- Via the [CLI ](/cli).
