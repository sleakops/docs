# Deployment

In Sleakops a deployment is the last step in getting your cloud infrastructure ready. Once all services are created a project can be deployed in a selected environment.
Remember that a project and environment make a namespace in a cluster. Sleakops will provide a Kubernetes deployment in the aforementioned cluster with all the services from the project.

## Create deployments

To create a deployment for a project in an environment you need to provide a [environment](./environment), [project](./project) and a [release](./deployment/release)


## How SleakOps handle deployments

When you creates a Sleakops deployment a Helm release will be installed in your [cluster](../cluster) using a Helm chart built when a [release](./release) is created
A Kubernetes deployment will pull an image (named as: environment_name-latest), built in [initial-build](../project/initial-build), from the corresponding image repository (aws ECR) built in [project](../project)
and decired numbers of Kubernete pods will be created, running the decired image. A Kubernete service and ingress will be created to allow the creation of the corresponding subdomains




## Cloud resources


When you create a deployment in Sleakops, the related cluster will receive these entities:

- a Kubernetes deployment for each web-service and worker Sleakops services types
- a Kubernetes service for each web-service Sleakops services type
- a Kubernetes Ingress for each web-service Sleakops services type
- a Kubernetes hpa for each Sleakops service
- a Kubernetes job for each job-service Sleakops service type
- a Kubernetes cronjob for each cronjob-service Sleakops service type
- a Kubernetes release for each Sleakops release
