# Deployment

A Deployment in Sleakops means the introduction of a new version of your application. This involves three primary components, collectively representing a Helm Release:
- [Releases](/deployment/release.mdx): This is a versioned combination of your [Services](/service) such as WebServices, Workers, CronJobs, and Hooks.
- Build Image: Represented by a [Build](/project/build).
- Configuration Values: This includes resources like [Volumes](/cluster/volumes.mdx) and [VariableGroups](/vargroup).

Whenever there's an update to any of these resources, Sleakops will prompt you for a Deployment through the unpublished banner displayed [below](#unpublished-banner).

## How SleakOps Handles Deployments

To execute the deployment, we use images saved in your project's image repository (AWS ECR), we push them at the moment you establish a [Build ](/project/build). When a Deployment is created, we pull the image corresponding to the Build being deployed. 

The subsequent step involves creating and deploying the Helm chart. We build it, upload it to the ECR and use it to establish a Helm Release. The Helm release includes required Kubernetes services, ingresses, workers, and other services are created.

:::info

All these resources reside in your own AWS Accounts. Sleakops does not exclusively store any data.

## How to Create a Deployment

There are multiple ways to generate a Deployment, these are shown [below ](#running-a-deploy). Be aware that we enforce some Deployments to maximize uptime and ensure the current state of the deployed infrastructure remains unaffected.

:::caution Forced Deployment

Currently, in certain scenarios, Sleakops enforces some Deployments. Read [here ](#forced-deployments) to understand when and why we do this.

### Running a Deploy {#running-a-deploy}

If it's not a forced deployment, we'll show you a switcher to decide if you want to deploy your changes.

- [Service](/service/index.mdx): Allows you to decide whether to Deploy the changes unless you modify the 'alias' configuration, which forces a deployment. This Deployment always creates a new Helm chart.
- [VariableGroup](/vargroup): Functions similar to Services but does not create a new Helm chart. It only changes the [values ](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/) of the Deployment.
- [Dependency](/dependency): Enforces a Deployment to deploy its related VariableGroup, which your Services might require to function.

If you don't deploy your changes when you make them or if your change doesn't force a deployment, then you have three ways to execute a Deployment:

- [Build section](/project/build): From the Deploy button, you can select which Build you wish to deploy.

- Unpublished Changes Banner: This banner appears when something is yet to be deployed on the cluster. Using this banner, you can opt to deploy only the VariableGroups and not the Services in 'draft' state.

</Zoom>

- Using the [CLI ](/cli).

#### Forced Deployments {#forced-deployments}

For clarification, forced deployments are sometimes necessary to minimize the downtime of the services deployed on the Cluster and also to ensure your services function properly. This is because the Helm templates should always be updated with the Kubernetes Secrets existing in the namespace to avoid failures. The actions that will enforce a deployment are:

- Service Alias configuration changes: Required to update the Kubernetes Ingress resource.
- Dependency deletion: Necessary to update the templates with the deletion of its related VariableGroup/Secret.
- VariableGroup deletion: Functions the same as Dependency deletion.
