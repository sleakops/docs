# VariableGroups

A **Vargroup** in SleakOps is a resource that securely stores sensitive information (like database credentials) within your EKS cluster. It ensures that credentials and environment-specific variables are securely managed and easily accessible by your applications.

<details>
<summary>
**Can I edit a VariableGroup created by SleakOps?**
</summary>
Yes, you can access and manage the Variable Group for your MySQL instance from the SleakOps console. You can modify values such as usernames, passwords, or any other environment-specific credentials.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
**How are Vargroups used by my applications?**
</summary>
Vargroups are securely injected into your application's environment when it is deployed. Your applications can access these credentials and other variables without exposing sensitive information in the code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
**How does SleakOps ensure the security of Vargroups?**
</summary>
SleakOps securely stores vargroups as Kubernetes secrets inside your EKS cluster. Access is controlled via Kubernetes Service Accounts, ensuring that only authorized components can access the sensitive information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
**Can I delete a Variable Group?**
</summary>
Yes, they can be deleted or updated as needed. However, be cautious when deleting them, as it may disrupt your application.

<details>
<summary>
**What is the difference between a Global and a Service-Scoped Vargroup?**
</summary>
- **Global**: Available to all services within the namespace. It is created without selecting a specific service. To create them select “global” 
- **Service-Scoped Variable Group**: Only applies to the selected service within the project and environment. It overrides global var group values if they have the same key. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
**What happens if there are duplicate keys in different Vargroups?**
</summary>
If duplicate keys exist across different var groups:
- If the key exists in both a global and a service-scoped var group, the service-scoped value takes precedence. 
- If two global vargroups have the same key, the most recently created one will be used.

### 2. Select a Project and complete the needed attributes
Complete the following attributes to create a new vargroup:

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Project** | The specific application or workload within SleakOps. Determines the scope of the variable group. |
| **Service** | A microservice or component within the project. If selected, the vargroup is limited to it; otherwise, by selecting global it'll be accessible into the namespace. |
| **Name** | A unique identifier for the var group, used to differentiate it within the project. Should be descriptive of the group's purpose. |
| **Deploy** | Enable this option if you want SleakOps to automatically publish and deploy your service into the project. |
