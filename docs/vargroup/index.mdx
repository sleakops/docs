# Variable Group

In Sleakops a Variable group or var group for short is a set of key-value pairs as in a dictionary that provides configuration for a service in a given project and environment.

## Create a var group

To create a var group you need to define a project, environment, service and an identification name for the group. Then you can provide as many key-value pairs as needed.
Remember that keys must be unique within the var group.

### Cloud resources

For the time being, Sleakops doesn't generate any resources in your provider to store the variable group.
