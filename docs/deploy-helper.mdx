# Sleakops onboarding

Sleakops onboarding page is a step-by-step guide to help you deploy your infrastructure faster.
It will guide you from the creation of a [Provider](/provider/index.mdx) to the [Deployment](/deployment/index.mdx).

## Introduction

The onboarding starts with some introduction pages that explain the previous steps users need to make to start using SleakOps.
An AWS account with an access key and secret key is mandatory to continue to the next part.
